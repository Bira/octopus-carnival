<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Dragonborn are a 4e original! The name appears in 3.x, but it was used for a
different concept there. They’re introduced as a PC race in the Player’s
Handbook, and in this entry we get stats for them as possible opposition for a
range of levels. They’re present on both the Monster Manual and the Monster
Vault.</p>

<p>The introduction of dragonborn was one of the many things that fueled the
edition wars, as traditionalist fans complained about how these newfangled
dragon-people had replaced gnomes in the PHB lineup. They dropped this
particular complaint from their repertoire pretty quickly, though! It turns out
the ability to play a dragon person from level 1 was <em>really, really popular</em>
among the majority of the player base, far more than the ability to play a
gnome. It helps that dragonborn are really interesting on their own, too!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dragonborn have a special creation myth. While most other races were pretty much
all the direct creation of a deity or another, they were created from the blood
of Io when he was split in half by the King of Terror. Whether this is true or
not depends on the GM, as with all creation myths.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth might be, you can’t deny they share a lot in common with
dragons. There is of course their appearance - tall and muscular with
draconic-looking heads, scale-covered skin. There’s also the elemental breath
weapon possessed by each individual. Dragonborn scale colors vary, but they
don’t stick to the usual dragon pallete or have any relation to the element of
their breath weapon.</p>

<p>Their culture was heavily influenced by this draconic connection. In ancient
times they used to run the world-spanning empire of Arkhosia, which eventually
fell due to a cataclysmic war with the human empire of Bael Turath. Today they
don’t have a nation to call their own, and live both in small communities and
intermingled in more diverse societies. The value Arkhosia placed on personal
honor and martial excellence still remains a strong trait of the surviving
dragonborn communities.</p>

<p>Many dragonborn adventurers are paladins or other champions of justice - their
emphasis on honor makes this a popular path for them. However, “honorable”
doesn’t always mean “good”, so they’re just as likely to appear as opposition
for a group of Good adventurers as members of any other sapient race.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All dragonborn are Medium Natural Humanoids, and despite their draconic
connection they do <em>not</em> have the Dragon keyword. This doesn’t mean much, but I
thought I should note it. Their signature abilities are the same as those of PC
dragonborn - an elemental breath weapon usable once per encounter, and an
ability that grants them +1 to all attacks while bloodied. The MV entries are
both unaligned, but all the ones in the MM have an alignment of “Any”, which is
really something that should appear more in D&amp;D monster entries.</p>

<p>Going in order of level, our first entry is the MV-only <strong>Dragonborn
Mercenary</strong>, a Level 2 Skirmisher with 38 HP. It wears hide armor and fights
with a battleaxe, whose attacks allow it to shift 2 squares on a hit in addition
to their damage. Once per encounter it can use an Overwhelming Strike that does
roughly double damage and causes the target to grant combat advantage (save
ends) on a hit. On a miss, it still does half damage. The mercenary also
breathes lightning.</p>

<p>For passive traits, the mercenary has Skirmish, which is shared by some other
skirmisher monsters: if he ends a move on his turn at least 4 squares from his
starting position, he gains +1d6 damage with all attacks until the start of his
next turn. This incentivizes him to keep moving around and charge whenever
possible. He also gains +1 to all attacks while bloodied.</p>

<p>Next we have the <strong>Dragonborn Soldier</strong>, present in both books. This is a Level
5 Soldier with 63 HP. It wears scale, wields a light shield and a longsword, and
breathes cold. It has a couple of triggered abilities to go with its basic
longsword attack: Impetuous Spirit is at-will and allows it to make a free basic
attack against an enemy that leaves its reach, even when that enemy does so by
shifting; Martial Recovery allows it to essentially reroll a missed basic
attack, and recharges when the soldier uses Impetuous Spirit. A few of these in
formation would be pretty awesome!</p>

<p>All other entries from here on are MM-only.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dragonborn Gladiator</strong> is a Level 10 Soldier with 106 HP. It wears scale,
wields a bastard sword, and breathes fire. The gladiator has a distinctive
fighting style expressed in a couple of passive traits: Lone Fighter grants it a
+2 attack bonus when adjacent to only one enemy; Gladiator’s Strike makes its
opportunity attacks knock the target prone on a hit. Against a bloodied target,
the Gladiator can use a Finishing Blow, which does extra damage and gives its
allies +2 to hit the target for a turn. This is an at-will power!</p>

<p>The gladiator really wants to isolate a weak PC from the rest of the group and
sword it to death. You should pair it with some different soldier monsters to
make it harder for the PCs to help their buddy and with some artillery to take
advantage of Finishing Blow.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dragonborn Raider</strong> is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 129 HP. It wears
leather, wields paired katars, and breathes acid. Katars are a High Crit weapon,
so the raider’s basic attack has that property as well. If it doesn’t perform
move actions in a turn, it can shift 1 square and attack twice with the katars,
in any order. If it has combat advantage, it deals +1d6 damage on its attacks.</p>

<p>Finally, it has an Infiltrating Stride ability that allows it to shift 3
squares. This recharges after it uses the twin katar strike, and it’s a move
ability (so it can’t use both abilities on the same turn).</p>

<p>To close this entry, we have the epic <strong>Dragonborn Champion</strong>, a Level 26 Soldier
with 239 HP. It wears plate, wields a heavy shield and a bastard sword, and
breathes lightning. It also has 30 resistance to every chromatic dragon element
(acid, cold, fire, lightning and poison)!</p>

<p>Its basic bastard sword attack allows a secondary attack against Fortitude on a
hit, which stuns the target for a turn and knocks it prone. The champion also
does extra damage against prone targets. When first bloodied, it can attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1 with the sword (though that doesn’t have the
secondary attack). Its final ability is Shake it Off, a free action that allows
it to immediately succeed on a saving throw against a (save ends) effect. This
recharges on a 2-6, so it’s almost always ready but wouldn’t allow it to shake
multiple effects off.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the champion good at both <em>fighting</em> and <em>helping</em> chromatic dragons,
since they would have little to fear from their breath weapons either
way. Dragons also tend to have powers that knock people prone, and an at-will
stun is an excellent thing to use against a dragon.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM has two sample encounters for this whole lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 dragonborn soldier, 2 tiefling darkblades, 1 rage drake and 5 human
lackeys. Some sort of bandit gang, probably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 3 dragonborn raiders, 1 firebelcher dragonspawn and 1 ogre
warhulk. The dragonspawn there clearly indicates this is a task force of
Tiamat cultists.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like dragoborn! I pretty much enumerated the reasons for this back at the
start. They make an excellent addition to the roster of playable character
races, and WotC obviously agrees with me since they kept them around mostly
unchanged for 5th edition.</p>

<p>The specific stat blocks here work well enough, and I particularly like the
soldier and the champion (if its damage is fixed).</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>A Dracolich is what you get when a dragon decides to perform the unspeakable
rites of lichdom. Due to the vagaries of alphabetical ordering, we get to look
at them before we dive into the huge “Dragon” entry. They’re present on both the
Monster Manual and the Vault, though they’re mixed in with the living dragons in
the later.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I simply must start this section by making a direct quote from the MM:
“Dracoliches are selfish, greedy, and interested only in amassing more power and
treasure.” So, pretty much like standard dragons? Both books have a lot more
about them, I just thought that sentence in particular was funny.</p>

<p>Dragons are long-lived but not immortal, so a dragon might choose to become a
lich to escape death much like a human wizard would. It’s also possible for a
dragon to be made into a dracolich against its will, usually by some sinister
cults looking to bag themselves a powerful servant.</p>

<p>Needless to say, dracoliches are pretty evil. The voluntary version of the
ritual requires the same sort of livelie awfulnesse that only true villains
would be willing to perform - if you weren’t officially Evil before performing
it, you certainly are afterwards. The involuntary version leaves the dragon
under the control of the (also inevitably evil) group who performed it.</p>

<p>I suppose a dracolich who was turned involuntarily and manages to break free of
its controllers could be unaligned or even good depending on how it was in
life. Of course, if it was your typical evil chromatic then freedom won’t do
much to improve its disposition.</p>

<p>Dracoliches aren’t reliant on phylacteries at all. The involuntary ritual
produces one as the key to controlling the dracolich, so you actually have a
situation where the lich wants to destroy its own phylactery here. In either
case, destroying the dracolich’s body slays it for good, with the control
phylactery shattering if it still exists when the monster dies.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault adds that lichdom makes dragons more scheming and manipulative
than they were in life. They’ll develop intricate plans and conspiracies to
increase their own power, and establish large networks of minions and servants
to accomplish these goals. If your dragons already do that, then I guess
dracolichs are even more meddlesome. Or maybe they go after living dragons with
much less regard for diplomacy than usual, since it’s likely they see themselves
as superior to their living brethren.</p>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons has never been a game to provide just one stat block for a
given type of dragon, and here this extends to the dracolich as well. The
Monster Manual has no less than three variants, and the Monster Vault has two
more. I’ll cover each book in its own section.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The “basic” MM <strong>Dracolich</strong> is a Huge Natural Magical Beast (dragon,
undead). This is a perfect example of how the undead keyword is different from
the shadow origin! This dracolich is a Level 18 Solo Controller with 885 HP,
equivalent to an elder dragon. It has darkvision and trained Perception. It’s
immune to disease, fear, and poison, has 30 necrotic resistance and 10 radiant
vulnerability. It runs at Speed 8 and flies at Speed 10 (but clumsily). Like all
solo monsters, it has +5 to all saves and 2 Action Points. Being a high-level MM
monster, its attacks suffer pretty heavily from the damage bug, so you’d need to
fix that before using it.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 3 bite that does physical damage, and extra necrotic
damage to stunned targets. It can also attack with a Recharge 5-6 breath weapon,
a Close Blast <em>9</em> that targets Reflex. A hit does necrotic damage and stuns for
a turn. A miss still does half damage but doesn’t stun. And either way the
targets lose any necrotic resistance they had (save ends).</p>

<p>You know I actually don’t mind this breath having low damage so much. That’s a
huge area and some pretty heavy riders. You might as well say every PC is
affected every time unless one of them is a ranger who likes to snipe from off
the map or something. Measuring the exact area of effect of the dracolich’s
necrotic breath becomes more important if it has allies. This isn’t a
party-friendly attack and even undead will be negatively affected by it.</p>

<p>This cloud of death isn’t the only source of stuns for the dracolich. It also
has Frightening Presence, that draconic staple. This is an encounter power that
affects a Close Burst 10 (i.e, every PC) and targets Will. Targets hit by the
attack are stunned for a turn, and take a -2 penalty to attacks until the end of
the encounter.</p>

<p>If that isn’t enough, it still has a couple of triggered actions. As an
interrupt when someone makes a melee attack against it, it can deploy a
Mesmerizing Glare. This attack against Will stuns for a turn on a hit, and
inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn on a miss. Since it’s an interrupt,
either effect can preempt the attack that triggered it. Oh, and it’s a Close
Blast 3, so it can end up stunning more people than just the attacker. And then
we have the other draconic staple, Bloodied Breath, which allows the dracolich
to recharge and use its breath immediately upon being bloodied.</p>

<p>The written tactics for it are to use the breath first, then enter melee and
spend an action point to use Frightful Presence. The last action point should be
saved for a tactical retreat - this guy is a mastermind, not a “fight to the
death” type.</p>

<p>Following this we have the <strong>Blackfire Dracolich</strong>, a bigger and badder
version. It’s Gargantuan (the largest size category in 4e), and a Level 23 Solo
Controller with 1095 HP. It has all of the basic model’s traits with numbers
increased due to level. Its necrotic resistance is 35, but its radiant weakness
is still at 10. The reach of its melee attacks is 4.</p>

<p>The Blackfire Dracolich has one extra attack on top of all the things from the
basic model: the titular Blackfire, a secondary breath weapon that affects a
Close Blast 5, hits <em>automatically</em>, does necrotic and ongoing fire damage, and
recharges on a 4-6.</p>

<p>To finish it off we have the <strong>Runescribed Dracolich</strong>, a yet more powerful
version. This one is a Level 29 Solo Controller with 1335 HP. It has everything
the Blackfire Dracolich has, and a few things more. Its necrotic resistance is
40, which I think is the highest resistance I’ve seen anywhere so far (not
counting complete immunities). It’s “final boss” material for a campaign that
reaches the mid-epics, and could be an exarch or lieutenant for an
undeath-focused final boss like Orcus.</p>

<p>This top-end variation has all of the Blackfire Dracolich’s attacks, plus
Runescribed Retaliation. This is an interrupt that triggers when the dracolich
is targeted by a ranged attack. It allows the monster to make a very accurate
attack against the attacker’s Will, and on a hit the monster can redirect the
incoming attack to any other target within 5 squares of it. The attacker still
has to roll to hit the new target, but they can’t miss on purpose.</p>

<p>It appears that MM dracoliches in general are less focused on performing
multiple actions and more focused on denying the PC’s actions, with this liberal
use of at-will stunning.</p>

<p>The sample encounter here is Level 20: a basic dracolich and a party of
high-powered yuan-ti. You can stop wondering about which sort of cult would want
their own dracolich lackey.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault starts us off at a more humble place with the <strong>Deathbringer
Dracolich</strong>. It’s Large, and a Level 12 Solo Controller with 492 HP, equivalent
to an adult dragon. Like the MM variants, it has trained Perception and
Darkvision. It’s immune to disease and poison, but not fear. It’s necrotic
resistance is 10, as is its radiant vulnerability. It runs at speed 6 and flies
clumsily at speed 8.</p>

<p>Like a living dragon, this dracolich has Action Recovery, which automatically
ends any dazing, stunning or dominating effects on the monster when it ends its
turn. It also can use its Mesmerizing Gaze (below) automatically on an
initiative of 10+its initiative result for the fight.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 bite that does physical damage and ongoing
necrotic damage. It can instead make two Reach 2 Claw attacks, which slide the
target 2 squares even if they don’t hit. Its breath weapon is a Close Blast 5
that targets Reflex, does necrotic damage and weakens (save ends). On a miss it
still does half damage and weakens for a turn.</p>

<p>The afore-mentioned Mesmerizing Gaze is a minor action Ranged 10 attack,
targetting Will and dominating (save ends) on a hit. On a miss it does 15
psychic damage if the target willingly moves closer to the dracolich before the
end of the target’s next turn. Either way it slides the target 2 squares. Make
sure to keep these effects in mind, because this attack is going to happen <em>a
lot</em>.</p>

<p>Then we have the <strong>Dracolich Doomlord</strong>, a Huge Level 22 Solo Controller with
840 HP whose power level is on par with the living elder dragons from this
book. Its necrotic resistance increases to 15, and is speed to “8, fly
10”. Everything else is comparable to the basic model aside from level-based
number increases.</p>

<p>The doomlord gains a new passive trait: the Aura of Doom has a radius of 3 and
prevents any enemies inside from regaining HP or gaining temporary HP. Yikes!
Its breath weapon regains the ability to remove necrotic resistance (save ends)
as an effect, but its mesmerizing gaze loses the “take damage if you come
closer” curse on a miss. Here’s someone who will try to keep the whole party
within the aura of doom at all times, and likely go for the healers first. It
has enough HP to eat a few opportunity attacks from defenders in order to do
that.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dracoliches feel somehow scarier than the Tarrasque, even though they’re lower
level. Fighting the MM variants in particular seems like it would be pure agony
for the players, with the stuns flowing freely. I can see why they switched to a
more multi-action solo stat block for the MV. I can also see why the MV lumped
them in with the other dragons. As we’re about to see, they’re really very
similar, and fill the Controller niche that was missing from lineup of living
chromatics.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Doppelgangers have been in D&amp;D forever, in one form or another. As is common
with 4e, they’re a little different here than they were in older editions. This
time, however, it’s 3.5’s fault. They’re in both the Monster Manual and the
Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>4e Doppelgangers are essentially Eberron’s Changelings given a more generic
treatment. In earlier editions changelings were people who descended from a
“real” doppelganger, but here the two words mean the same thing. I don’t think
anything of value has been lost with the change - the defining trait of a
doppelganger in any edition is its ability to change shape, and that has been
retained.</p>

<p>Much like humans, doppelgangers are people who can have any disposition and
alignment imaginable. They don’t have any kingdoms or settlements of their own,
and tend to live in those of other races, usually in disguise. I suspect most of
them really do want to live peaceful lives, and maybe have a private space where
they can drop the disguises and relax a bit.</p>

<p>When they turn to riskier pursuits, though, their abilities make excellent at
infiltration, spying, and all sorts of other underhanded activities. That’s
great when they’re on your side, and terrible when they’re on the enemy’s.</p>

<p>About 90% of the lore entry for the Monster Vault then goes on to describe the
terrible things an infiltrated doppelganger cell can do. They can live
undercover for years if necessary! They can disable a city’s defenses from the
inside! Kill and impersonate anyone! Your whole family could have been replaced
by doppelgangers and you’d have no way to tell! Fear! Uncertainty! Doubt!
Despite the assertion that doppelgangers can be of any alignment the tone here
assumes none of them are ever up to any good.</p>

<p>I’m guessing the peaceful folks have a really hard time with prejudice from
“righteous citizens” who think they’re all evil infiltrators.</p>

<p>As you’d expect, the Eberron setting treats them a lot better, and makes them
valid PC choices.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Doppelgangers are Medium Natural Humanoids (shapechangers). They have a base
speed of 6, and their signature ability is Change Shape. This minor action lets
them take the form of any Medium humanoid. It can be used at will, and they can
hold any given form indefinitely, though the disguise drops automatically if
they hit 0 HP.</p>

<p>It’s possible to copy specific individuals. Discovering the ruse requires an
Insight check on the part of the observer. According to the MM, this is opposed
by the doppelganger’s Bluff with a +20 bonus; the MV gives fixed DCs for each
stat block that are somewhat lower than that, though still quite hard.</p>

<p>Any additional abilities doppelgangers have aside from changing shape are the
product of training, same as with humans. Technically this means they could be
paladins and wizards and so on, but all the stat blocks we get here are for the
stereotypical rogue-types.</p>

<p>The <strong>Doppelganger Sneak</strong> is a Level 3 Skirmisher with 45 HP, present in both
books. It attacks with a short sword for level-appropriate damage, has a
rogue-like sneak attack ability, and can use a Shapeshifter Feint as an at-will
minor action that targets Will to gain combat advantage against someone for a
turn if they don’t have it from other sources. It’s Unaligned, and the Insight
DC for its Change Shape is 30 in the Vault.</p>

<p>The <strong>Doppelganger Assassin</strong> is a Level 8 Lurker with 69 HP, present only in
the MM. It uses a dagger as a weapon, deals more sneak attack damage than the
sneak, and can use Shapeshifter Feint. It has one additional ability in Cloud
Mind. This encounter power targets the will of everyone in a Close
Burst 5. The assassin becomes invisible to anyone it hits with this attack. It
lasts for as long as the assassin sustains it (which requires a minor action on
its turn), and drops if it either attacks or is hit by an attack. This one is
Evil because it’s an assassin, not because it’s a doppelganger. Since it shares
a lot of abilities with the sneak and Cloud Mind is more of an escape hatch than
an attack power, it should really be a skirmisher.</p>

<p>The <strong>Doppelganger Infiltrator</strong> is a Level 11 Lurker with 90 HP present only in
the MV. In addition to the Change Shape ability shared by all doppelgangers, it
also has an improved version called Perfect Replica. This is a standard action
that targets an adjacent Medium creature and hits automatically. The
doppelganger copies the target’s appearance (including gear!) and immobilizes it
for a turn. If the infiltrator attacks the target with its dagger while it’s so
immobilized, it deals an extra 6d8 damage, which is considerable given its basic
dagger damage is 2d4+6.</p>

<p>If someone attacks the doppelganger whie it’s affecting someone with Perfect
Replica, it can use an opportunity action to automatically swap places with the
victim so that the attack targets them instead. It’s the classic “who is the
real one?” scenario, but no matter who you choose, you’ll choose wrong. The
Insight DC for its Change Shape ability is 32.</p>

<p>Finally we have the <strong>Doppelganger Master Assassin</strong>, a Level 19 Lurker with 142
HP present only in the MV. This seems to be a properly lurker-ish version of the
Assassin we already saw. It also uses a dagger to fight, and has a special
Assassin’s Strike that does a whole pile of necrotic damage on top of the usual
dagger damage, recharging when the master assassin uses Vanish. Vanish, in turn,
is a standard action that makes the doppelganger invisible for a turn and allows
it to shift its speed.</p>

<p>As a passive trait, the master assassin has Blend In: it can make Stealth checks
to become hidden as long as it’s adjacent to at least one other creature. It
remains hidden even if it doesn’t have cover or concealment, which is
significant since stealth rules had become a lot more strict by the time the MV
came out. This is perfect for disappearing in the midst of a crowd, or again for
re-enacting the “who’s the real one?” scenario when the adjacent creature is a
PC. Only this time you <em>can</em> choose the right one if you have enough Insight. I
guess the assassin spent more time training to stab people than honing their
shapeshifting like the infiltrator. <em>This</em> assassin is Unaligned, and their
Insight DC is 38.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 3: a sneak, 3 human guards, and a human
mage. Looks like this sneak just wants to live out a regular life as a member of
the city watch. It’s likely its buddies don’t even know it’s a doppelganger.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like Eberron changelings so much I <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/19/changelings-dfrpg.html">wrote them up for GURPS</a>. They work
well as a PC race! As possible opposition these stat blocks work well. If some
villain is going to hire assassins to go after a late-paragon party, those
assassins are probably going to be doppelgangers or the equivalent.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Like beholders and mind flayers, Displacer Beasts are one of those monsters who
are so uniquely D&amp;D that they’ve been excluded from the SRD. They look like big
black panthers with two squid-like tentacles protruding from their shoulder
blades. The trait that gives them their name, however, is the ability to look
like they’re about two meters to the left of their real location. They appear
both on the Monster Manual and on the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual contains only the usual couple of paragraphs for its entries,
but the MV piles on the lore.</p>

<p>Displacer beasts are native to the Feywild, but can also be found in the world.
They’re cunning carnivores who make extensive use of their illusory powers both
to hunt and to escape from danger. Their preferred habitats are dense forests
with plenty of foliage and caves to use as hiding spots. When hunting, they
stalk their prey and attack from ambush at the most opportune time.</p>

<p>These creatures have gained such fame for their strength and cunning that they
often feature in heraldic devices for noble houses and organizations that want
to be known for possessing these qualities.</p>

<p>As magical beasts they’re smarter than most animals, but still have a bestial
disposition. They have no language or civilization, but they are quite able to
set up really clever ambushes, track prey by following clues in addition to
using their scent, remember good hunting spots like, say, a seasonal trade
route. They’re also smart enough to retreat if outmatched, and prefer attacking
animals to humanoids.</p>

<p>Though displacer beasts rarely gather in groups larger than a mated pair,
particularly large and intelligent specimens have been known to form and lead
packs composed mostly of other, lesser predators. Some humanoids can also
befriend them and employ them for hunting, war, or guarding territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The standard <strong>Displacer Beast</strong> has MM and MV versions. In both, it’s a Large
Fey Magical Beast, and a Level 9 Skirmisher with 97 HP. Its Speed is 12, it’s
trained in Perception and has low-light vision.</p>

<p>The displacer beast has two passive traits: Threatening Reach and the expected
Displacement. The first makes it able to perform opportunity attacks against
targets anywhere within the reach of its attacks, and applies mainly to the
tentacles. The displacement power has significantly different wording between
versions.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual says all melee and ranged attacks have a 50% chance to miss
the beast. The effect ends when the beast is hit by an attack but it resumes
when it moves 2+ squares on its turn.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault clarifies the miss chance: any melee or ranged attack that
would hit the beast actually misses if the attack roll was odd. You can see how
13th Age evolved from D&amp;D 4 here! The effect still stops when the beast does get
hit, but it resumes automatically at the start of its next turn.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 tentacle, which in the MM suffers from the damage
bug. It also has a slightly stronger Reach 1 bite. The MM version has a Beast’s
Fury standard-action ability that allows it to make two tentacle attacks and a
bite against a single target it has combat advantage against. The MV trades that
for Cunning Blitz, which allows it to shift half its speed (6 squares!) and make
tentacle attacks against one or two targets.</p>

<p>Both versions can shift 1 square as a reaction when an attack misses them,
though the MM version weirdly restricts that to attacks that miss because of the
displacement. I prefer the broader MV power here.</p>

<p>The MV-only <strong>Savage Displacer Beast</strong> is the slower, beefier variant. A Level
11 Brute with 136 HP, it loses the Perception training and runs at “only” Speed
8.</p>

<p>The Displacement and Threatening Reach abilities are the same, but this beast
prefers to push others around instead of shifting. Its tentacle and bite attacks
do level-appropriate Brute damage, and the tentacle pushes 1 square on a
hit. The beast can also push someone who misses it with a melee attack 1 square.</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong>Displacer Beast Pack Lord</strong>, present in both
books. It’s a Huge Fey Magical Beast and a Level 13 Elite Skirmisher with 258
HP. In both books, the Pack Lord has all the same abilities as the standard
beast, plus a few additions.</p>

<p>First, while the other two types of displacer beats have an Int of 4, the Pack
Lord has 10! As the name implies, this is the one that can tame other animals
and form them into a pack.</p>

<p>In addition to doing more damage with all of its attacks, it has Reach 3
tentacles. The MV version also gains an attack called Clear The Path, which
targets Reflex in a Close Burst 3 and slides everyone it hits up to 3
squares. On a miss, it does half damage and still slides the target 1
square. This recharges when the beast is first bloodied.</p>

<p>When someone misses the Pack Lord with an attack, both versions can make a
tentacle attack against the attacker in addition to shifting 1 square. It also
ignores all difficult terrain and penalties for squeezing, an ability which
surely makes it a joy to fight in a thicket tangled with undergrowth.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 13: a pack lord, two regular displacer beasts, and
a briar witch dryad. This is likely to be an equal partnership between the pack
lord and the dryad.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I definitely prefer the MV writeup on this one. It’s a little more powerful and
sounds a little more fun. I also like that the displacer beast is explicitly not
an “attacks on sight and fights to the death” monster, and someone who can talk
to animals can even make an ally of it. Even the regular variant: it has the
brainpower of your average ogre and a much better disposition (they’re
Unaligned).</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Rejoice, oh reader, for we are finally done with the devils! Our next monster is
no less horrific, but at at least it’s not a fiend.</p>

<p>I think devourers made their first appearance in D&amp;D 3.5. Third Edition tried
really hard to create a new generation of iconic monsters with mixed success at
best, but I think they got it right here. These things are scary! Despite this,
they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When a mortal dies their soul goes to the Shadowfell, where the Raven Queen
sorts it out and sends it on its way to the great beyond. When a <em>psychotic
serial killer</em> dies, there’s a chance their soul goes AWOL once it hits the
Shadowfell and builds itself a new body out of other people’s flesh and
bones. This is how devourers are made.</p>

<p>Devourers retain all the mental faculties they had in life, which means they get
to keep their Evil disposition and Hannibal Lecter-like intellect. There are
several varieties of devourer: some enjoy eating their victims still-pulsating
viscera, while others go straight for the soft, yummy soul at the center of
their flesh wrapping.</p>

<p>I suspect that given time they’d prepare some nicely cooked fava beans and a
bottle of Chianti to go with their victims, but they’ll eat them on the spot
mid-fight if they’re in a hurry.</p>

<p>Devourers are smart enough to value strategic alliances with other monsters, and
they’re even able to hold their unnatural appetite in check to work with living
allies. Of course, they’re still only going to ally with creatures that don’t
mind their proclivities.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three devourer varieties here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spirit Devourer</strong> is a Large Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 11
Elite Soldier with 224 HP. It’s trained in perception and has Darkvision. Being
undead, it’s immune to disease and poison, has Resist 15 Necrotic, and
Vulnerable 5 radiant. It moves with Speed 6.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a Reach 2 claw, but the real star of the show here is
Trap Spirit. This has Range 5 and targets the Fortitude of a living humanoid. On
a hit, the victim’s body vanishes and its spirit is trapped as an agonizing
effigy inside the devourer’s exposed rib cage (save ends). Until the victim
saves, it can do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>While the monster has a victim so trapped, it gains a +2 bonus to all defenses,
and access to two other actions. Devour Spirit is an at-will minor action that
does 10 damage to the victim, and either heals the devourer by the same amount
or allows it to immediately use Spirit Rupture. This is a standard action attack
that targets the Will of everyone in a Close Burst 1. On a hit, it does necrotic
damage and immobilizes the target for a turn. On a miss, it does half damage
without the status effect.</p>

<p>Should the victim be killed by Devour Spirit, it <em>can’t be resurrected by Raise
Dead</em>. This is particularly concerning here because I don’t think there’s any
other way to bring characters back from the dead at this level. At least, there
weren’t at the time this book was published.</p>

<p>The <strong>Viscera Devourer</strong> is a little different because it’s exposed abdominal
cavity comes pre-filled with squirming, drooling intestines tipped with gnashing
mouths. It’s a Medium Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 12 Controller with
124 HP. It has the same senses, resistances and speed as the Spirit Devourer.</p>

<p>Aside from the weaksauce basic claw attack, this devourer can use up to four of
its tentacle-like intestines as a weapon. Their Reach is 1, and on a hit they do
a bit of physical damage and grab the target. The devourer can grab up to four
victims this way, or use multiple bowels to grab a single target, giving them a
-2 to escape the grab for each extra intestine. Grabbed victims take 5 ongoing
necrotic damage for each appendage wrapped around them until they escape, with
the devourer gaining the same amount of HP as it drains their life.</p>

<p>Oh, and it also gains a +2 to all defenses while it has at least one person
grabbed.</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong>Soulspike Devourer</strong>, AKA the Big One. It’s a Huge
Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 20 Elite Soldier (Leader) with 376 HP. It
has the same speed, senses and resistances as its smaller cousins, though its
numbers here are more extreme: resist necrotic 20 and vulnerable 10 radiant.</p>

<p>The Soulspike Devourer’s gimmick is that it impales the souls of its victims on
the many bone spikes that protude from where its ribs should be. This happens
whenever its basic claw attack reduces a target to 0 HP. When encountered, the
devourer will probably have at least one spirit so impaled. It’s maximum
“capacity” is 4.</p>

<p>Impaled victims can’t perform actions at all. They can try to make a save to
escape when the devourer takes radiant damage, but otherwise they’re
helpless. The only other way to free them is to destroy the devourer. If either
of these things happen their body reappears next to the monster’s and can be
brought back to health in the usual way. The devourer and any allies within 10
squares of it gain a bonus to all their defenses equal to half the number of
soulspiked spirits.</p>

<p>The devourer’s other special attack is Soul Shatter, which targets Will on a
Close Burst 3, does a lot of necrotic damage, and <em>stuns</em> for a turn, after
which the targets are weakened (save ends). This recharges whenever the
devourer uses its variant of the Devour Spirit ability.</p>

<p>This, in turn, is a standard action that automatically <em>kills</em> one of the
soulspiked spirits and heals the devourer for 75 HP. The victim’s dead body
reappears adjacent to the monster, and it would seem that they can be
resurrected via Raise Dead normally.</p>

<p>The sample encounters showcase some of those unholy alliances. The first is
level 11, a spirit devourer, a vampire lord, and 5 vampire spawn. The second is
level 13, 2 viscera devourers working for a posse of drow.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Spooky! I also can kinda see why they didn’t make it into the Monster Vault - by
the time that book came out, monsters that heal themselves had gone out of
style. Still, I think they might be fine if used in moderation. The devourers
presented here are all in dire need of a damage fix, but otherwise they should
be able to scare your players both on a roleplaying and on a mechanical
level. The soulspike devourer in particular could literally eat an ice devil for
breakfast.</p>
