<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Wyverns have been in the game since its beginnings (or at least since
BECMI). Here, they are present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wyverns are the most famous “not-quite-dragons” of D&amp;D, and the ones most likely
to be confused with real dragons from a distance. The most obvious visual
difference is that wyverns lack front legs.</p>

<p>There are others, too, which become more evident when you interact more closely
with them. Unlike dragons, wyverns are non-sapient animals, and they also lack
magical breath weapons. Instead, they have a stinger at the tip of their tails
that can inject prey with a potent venom. They’re not as relentlessly voracious
as some of the other fantastic predators described in this book, but I imagine
they still might put a strain on any herds on their chosen territory.</p>

<p>In the wild, wyverns live in small groups called “flights”, which roost in high
places like mountains and hunt the surrounding region together. If you see a
flight of wyverns up close, it’s because they’re trying to eat you.</p>

<p>Wyverns can be tamed, but the process has to start shortly after they’re
born. As you might expect, there’s a market for eggs and hatchlings, and sapient
opponents might bring their pet wyverns to the fight.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for two species of wyverns here. Both are Large Beasts with the
Reptile keyword, and fight with their natural weapons: a bite, claws, and the
stinger. Wyverns are good fliers and much more agile in the air than on the
ground.</p>

<p>Note that wyvern damage as written is notoriously weak. Fixing this to use the
updated math should be a priority before you include them in an encounter.</p>

<h3 id="wyvern">Wyvern</h3>

<p>The more common variety is a Large Natural Beast with the Reptile and Mount
Keywords, and a Level 10 Skirmisher with 106 HP. Their land speed is 4, and
their flight speed is 8 with Hover.</p>

<p>Wyverns have two basic attacks: a <strong>bite</strong> with no special effects beyond
damage, and a slightly weaker attack with their <strong>claws</strong>, which can only be
done from the air and knocks prone on a hit. <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> allows them to fly
their speed and make one of these attacks at any point along the way without
drawing opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>They can also <strong>sting</strong>, of course, which does a little less damage than the
claw and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that deals ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the wyvern’s <strong>aerial agility</strong> gives its rider +2 to all
defenses.</p>

<p>I’m guessing the wyvern doesn’t bite very often. It’s going to use flyby attacks
to knock people prone, or sting if that’s not practical. Only a prone, poisoned
target will get the bite.</p>

<h3 id="fell-wyvern">Fell Wyvern</h3>

<p>A larger species which originated in the Shadowfell but is also present in
places where that plane intersects with the world. It’s a Large Shadow Beast and
a Level 24 Skirmisher with 228 HP. Despite not being undead, it has Resist 10
Necrotic and Vulnerable 5 Radiant. Its land speed is 6, and its fly speed is 12
with Hover.</p>

<p>Fell Wyverns fight mostly like wyverns with bigger numbers, and have all the
same attacks. Their venom causes “necrotic and poison” damage, so it’s harder to
resist. They can also use a <strong>pestilent breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6) that does immediate and ongoing necrotic damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a single sample encounter: level 10, an ettin marauder, a basilisk, and
2 wyverns.</p>

<p>I also imagine either wyvern is a pretty close fit to those fell beasts the
Ringwraiths rode in Lord of the Rings, though their actual level would depend on
how high-powered you view that story as.</p>

<p>Given that wyverns can be mounts, the most clichéd use for them would be to have
them as the “hostile humanoid” flying mount of choice, to have proper aerial
fights against human gryphon cavalry.</p>

<p>The first time I see the name “Worg” is in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Monster Manual,
where it was synonymous with “dire wolf”. The word itself comes from the Lord of
the Rings, I think. In Fourth Edition, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Worgs are not wolves, though they might be distantly related. Even dire wolves
are just animals, but worgs are sapient and evil. They also have some distinctly
un-wolf-like physical traits when you look at them from up close.</p>

<p>Worgs like the taste of sapient flesh and prefer it over any other prey. They
live in mazelike warrens, which they decorate with trophies of their
victims. Worgs on the hunt act as a group, but don’t cooperate very well, since
each individual is only interested in satisfying its own thirst for murder.</p>

<p>Worgs willingly ally with other sapient creatures that have a disposition as
nasty as their own, often carrying these allies into battle as mounts.</p>

<p>Oh, and the worg also has a larger and meaner relative: the elephant-sized
gulvoorg, which looks nothing like a wolf even from very far away.</p>

<p>I’m guessing you won’t find both worgs and normal wolves in the same wilderness
region - worgs are beefy enough to overpower even dire wolves in direct
fights. They’d enjoy it, too.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Both “strains” of worg are Natural Magical Beasts. They have trained Perception
and Darkvision.</p>

<h3 id="worg">Worg</h3>

<p>The basic model is Large and a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP. It has a speed of 8
and its <strong>Frightful Growls</strong> act as an aura (3) that gives enemies a -1 attack
penalty and allies a +1 attack bonus. Their only attack is a <strong>bite</strong> which also
does ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>I guess the main benefit of riding a worg into battle is that you’re always in
range of its aura.</p>

<h3 id="gulvoorg">Gulvoorg</h3>

</figure>

<p>These monsters are Huge, and Level 16 Elite Brutes with 384 HP. Their speed is
9, and they still have trained Perception and Darkvision.</p>

<p>Gulvoorg <strong>bites</strong> are Reach 2, and always knock prone on a hit. They can
perform Reach 2 <strong>tail slams</strong>, which are also considered basic attacks. On a
hit, they both knock prone and daze (save ends).</p>

<p>As a standard action they can use <strong>Gulvoorg Fury</strong> to make both a bite and a
slam attack, against different targets and with a -2 attack penalty. That
penalty is completely unnecessary, since we’re talking about an elite monster.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book gives us two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 3 worgs, 2 razorclaw stalker shifters, and 1 oni night haunter. An
oni and its evil henchthings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 gulvoorgs and 2 cyclops hewers. It’s even possible the cyclopes
are riding the gulvoorgs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Conceptually, I like worgs a lot more than I like dire wolves, and wouldn’t be
opposed to merging the two again. That way you get sapient evil worgs with the
interesting mechanical bits of dire wolves. Maybe add some wind powers so they
can huff, puff, and blow your house down.</p>

<p>Wolves are real animals and have been part of the game since its
beginnings. Here, they are both in the Monster Manual and in the Monster Vault’s
animal appendix.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Real-world wolves are pack hunters, and the ancestors of modern dogs. If I
recall correctly they mostly stay away from people and only attack when cornered
or really desperate. There are enough stories about wolves attacking sheep and
other farm animals that it must have happened in the past, but it’s not really a
common occurrence any more. And that’s partly because there are very few wolves
left in the real world.</p>

<p>D&amp;D wolves are of course a lot more common and a lot more willing to attack
people, since a pack of wolves is a classic low-level wilderness encounter. They
can be found across a wide variety of climates and terrains. Mountains? Check!
Forests? Check! Plains? Check! Deserts? Why not?</p>

<p>This being D&amp;D, there might be some natural landscapes where your reasonably
realistic grey wolf might have trouble competing with the more fantastical and
powerful monsters common to the game. Instead, these places might feature dire
wolves, which are a larger, smarter and more dangerous variety. As of 3e,
they’re also spikier.</p>

<p>In addition to being found in the wild, both common and dire wolves might be
trained by humanoids such as goblins or shifters, who have a knack for taming
wolves directly without having to spend centuries turning them into dogs. Other
creatures might also control large packs of them through magic: vampires are
famous for this.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Wolves are obviously Natural Beasts, even the dire variety. They have low-light
vision, and their other acute senses are represented by Trained Perception. They
run at speed 8, attack with <strong>bites</strong> and usually do something interesting when
they have combat advantage.</p>

<h3 id="gray-wolf-both">Gray Wolf (Both)</h3>

<p>Gray wolves are Medium, and Level 2 Skirmishers with 38 HP. As far as natural
wolves go, it seems to me these would be on the large end of the scale, which
might explain why they’re more eager to attack humans than you’d expect a
mundane wolf to be.</p>

<p>Their sole attack is the <strong>bite</strong>, which does extra damage against prone
targets. The bite in the MV version also allows the wolf to shift 4 squares <em>as
an effect</em>, so these critters will never stay still if they can help it.</p>

<p>If a wolf has <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> against a target, its bite will also knock
the target prone on a hit. This means a group of wolves has a lot of incentive
to flank a specific PC. One of them knocks the victim prone with its first bite,
the others pile on with that bonus bite damage. All of them keep moving around
with those free shifts. And now you know why they call this “wolf-pack tactics”!</p>

<h3 id="dire-wolf-both">Dire Wolf (Both)</h3>

<p>Dire wolves are Large, which means each is roughly horse-sized. They’re Level 5
Skirmishers with the Mount keyword and 67 HP.</p>

<p>Dire wolf <strong>bites</strong> have larger numbers due to them being higher level, and also
do increased damage to prone targets. They also knock the target prone if the
wolf has <strong>combat advantage</strong> against the target, and the monsters have more
ways to get that other than plain old flanking.</p>

<p>The text for “combat advantage” in the MM version says the dire wolf has CA
against any target who has at least one other ally adjacent to it. No flanking
required. This could be interpreted to mean that a dire wolf with a rider always
has CA against any enemy adjacent to it! The MV version of this trait, named
<strong>Pack Harrier</strong>, says it only works when the wolf has two or more allies
adjacent to the enemy. So the rider still counts, but you need a second ally to
get the bonus.</p>

<p>They also have a trait called <strong>Pack Hunter</strong>, which grants their <em>rider</em> combat
advantage if an ally other than the mount is adjacent to the target. So if you
go with the MV text, the rider would get CA whenever the wolf got it, and
vice-versa.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that the MV version is the “correct” one in all aspects
here. A wolf that got permanent combat advantage against everyone would be a
little overpowered due to that knockdown effect on the bite.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two sample encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 3 gray wolves, 2 hobgoblin archers, and 1 hobgoblin warcaster. Your
standard hunting party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 3 dire wolves, and 2 longtooth shifter hunters. A mounted hunting
party.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Werewolves are also quite likely to be leading dire wolf packs, and Count Strahd
in the original Ravenloft module quite famously commanded a literal army of dire
wolves he could send after the PCs every night until they entered his castle.</p>

<p>Dire wolf-riding goblins are also a classic image, though the levels are a
little mismatched as printed. It would be easy enough to level the goblins up or
the dire wolves down, and it’s quite plausible for the Small goblins to be
riding Medium gray wolves instead of the Large dire ones.</p>

<p>These days “you’re attacked by a pack of wolves while on the road” strikes me as
a little uninspired, though I think they’re OK when used as muscle by sapient
opposition.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Wights have been in the game since its beginnings, part of the original Undead
Power Ladder. Here, they are present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I might have touched upon this before, but in the implied D&amp;D setting mortal
beings are composed of three main metaphysical “pieces”: the body, the soul, and
the will. The will is also known by sages as the “animus”, and is the “glue”
that holds body and soul together. This is also quite similar to Exalted’s
division of the body, “higher soul” and “lower soul”.</p>

<p>What usually happens when someone dies is that the soul separates from the body,
and the animus disintegrates. You get undead when something intereferes with
this process and the animus sticks around, or when someone introduces an
artificial animus into the equation via necromancy. What <em>type</em> of undead you
get depends on the final configuration of post-mortem body, soul and animus.</p>

<p>When the soul departs but the animus sticks to the body, you get a wight. Wights
are intelligent, since they retain the use of their brain-meats, but they’re not
really the same person they were in life. In place of a soul they have this
gaping void, which they are compelled to fill by slaying the living and drinking
their life force. A wight doesn’t <em>need</em> to do this in order to keep existing,
though, so they hang around for a long time in their haunts waiting for a victim
to wander by.</p>

<p>Wights typically inhabit the places where they died, though they are not really
bound to them. More ambitious wights might take over catacombs and crypts and go
about finding victims (and treasure!) in a more proactive way. These can find
themselves commanding lesser undead, or perhaps acting as lieutenants for more
powerful villains.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Wights are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. As such they’re
immune to disease and poison, and have tier-based necrotic resistance and
radiant vulnerability. They also have darkvision.</p>

<p>Wights are famously able to drain the life energy of others with a touch. In
previous editions this meant they drained levels (in AD&amp;D) or inflicted
“negative levels” (in 3e). Here this means they eat your healing surges.</p>

<p>While you can still get them back via a long rest, this does significantly
impact your resources, which is a real bummer in those instances where you can’t
just plop down and rest for six hours whenever the fancy strikes you.</p>

<h3 id="deathlock-wight">Deathlock Wight</h3>

<p>This one was either a necromancer in life, or learned how to be one after it
died. It’s a Level 4 Controller with 54 HP and all standard wight traits. Its
speed is 6.</p>

<p>A deathlock wight’s basic <strong>claw</strong> attack does necrotic damage, and causes the
target to lose a healing surge. Their <strong>Grave Bolt</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Reflex) is a
much better attack, dealing necrotic damage and immobilizing (save ends). Their
magically-enhanced <strong>Horrific Visage</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will; recharge 4-6)
does untyped damage and pushes victims 3 squares.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can <strong>Reanimate</strong> (Ranged 10; minor action) a fallen
non-minion undead ally. The target stands back up with 25% of its HP.</p>

<p>The MM stat block for deathlock wights has pitifully low damage all
around. Fixing this is a priority if you want to use them.</p>

<h3 id="wight">Wight</h3>

<p>The standard model is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 62 HP and all standard wight
traits. Its speed is 7.</p>

<p>The basic wight’s only attack are its life-draining <strong>claws</strong>, which do necrotic
damage, eat a healing surge, and allow it to shift up to 3 squares on a
hit. It’s simple, but the shift and the life-draining make it quite dangerous
since it can reach your squishies and ruin their day.</p>

<h3 id="battle-wight">Battle Wight</h3>

<p>A wight with more formal combat training. It wears plate, and wields a sword and
shield. It’s a level 9 Soldier with 98 HP and all standard wight traits, plus
speed 5.</p>

<p>The battle wight has learned to channel its dark powers through the sword, and
so its basic attack is a <strong>Souldraining Longsword</strong> that does necrotic damage,
eats a healing surge and immobilizes (save ends). It can also attack at range
with <strong>Soul Reaping</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). This only affects
immobilized targets, but deals high necrotic damage and heals the wight for 10
HP.</p>

<h3 id="battle-wight-commander">Battle Wight Commander</h3>

<p>A smarter and more powerful version of the Battle Wight, this one is a Level 12
Soldier (Leader) with 106 HP and all wight traits. It has the same gear as the
basic battle wight, and speed 5.</p>

<p>The commander’s <strong>Souldraining Longsword</strong> does everything the battle wight’s
does, and also weakens on a hit. A save ends both the immobilization and the
weakness. Soul Reaping gets upgraded to <strong>Soul Harvest</strong> (ranged 5
vs. fortitude; recharge 4-6) which works the same but heals both the commander
and 2 undead allies within 10 squares.</p>

<h3 id="slaughter-wight">Slaughter Wight</h3>

<p>Much like the basic wight, this one is a monstrosity in rags that attacks with
its claws. It’s just a whole lot stronger and tougher.</p>

<p>Slaughter wights are Level 18 Brutes with 182 HP, all standard wight traits, and
speed 7. Their <strong>claws</strong> do necrotic damage and have a lot of riders: eat a
healing surge, weaken (save ends), heal the wight for 15 HP, and a partrige in a
pear tree.</p>

<p>When killed, these monsters emit a <strong>Death Wail</strong> (close burst 5 vs. Fortitude),
which does necrotic damage to enemies in the area, and allows undead allies in
the area to make a basic attack as a free action.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get several encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 1 deathlock wight, 3 zombies, and 6 zombie rotters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 battle wight commander, 4 battle wights, 1 shadar-kai witch, 2
shadar-kai chainfighters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 2 slaughter wights, 3 abyssal ghouls, 1 nabassu gargoyle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wights are a very distinctly D&amp;D monster, but at the same time they kinda get
lost amid all the other similar undead in the game. This might explain why they
were left out of the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Warforged are a 3e creation, first appearing as a playable option in the Eberron
campaign setting. In 4e they would also become playable characters, but their
first appearance was in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The warforged lore given to us by the Monster Manual has been stripped of all
Eberron-specific information, which means it’s extremely terse and generic.</p>

<p>Warforged are living constructs created by magic. The “living” part means
they’re gifted with true sapience, and with souls. It also means they’re a
little less tough than a golem, but they make up for that with their large
numbers.</p>

<p>Warforged are created in magical factories called Creation Forges. They’re
sexless and can’t reproduce in any other way. As their name implies, the
original purpose of the warforged was to serve as an army. In peacetime,
individual warforged often end up working as bodyguards and mercenaries for
people who share their individual ideals and disposition.</p>

<p>In Eberron, the secret of building and operating creation forges belonged
exclusively to House Cannith, who sold warforged armies to all five sides of the
Last War but whose main customer was the nation of Cyre. The treaty that ended
the War (signed after Cyre got swallowed by a magical disaster) freed all
existing warforged from servitude, and I think it also tightly regulated their
creation.</p>

<p>Most warforged PCs from Eberron are going to be veterans of the Last War, which
is like a combination between our Hundred Years War and World War One. However,
in the ruins of Cyre, a powerful warforged supremacist named the Lord of Blades
controls a fully working creation forge and is using it to build an army.</p>

<p>Warforged in the 4e implied setting might have been alive to see the fall of
Nerath. They could also have been built more recently by someone operating an
Nerathian creation forge, or even assembled by hand by an isolated artificer.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Warforged are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Living Construct
keyword. Monster Manual warforged have several signature traits: they get a +2
to saves against ongoing damage, they employ <strong>Battlefield Tactics</strong> that grant
them a +1 bonus to melee attack if any ally is adjacen to the target, and they
can use the <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong> encounter power as a minor action when
bloodied to recover a healing surge’s worth of HP.</p>

<p>Playable Warforged would appear in the Eberron Player’s Guide: they’d get the
save bonus against ongoing damage and a modified form of <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong>,
along with a few other things.</p>

<h3 id="warforged-soldier">Warforged Soldier</h3>

<p>This is a Level 4 Soldier with 56 HP and all standard warforged traits. It wears
plate, and wields a longsword and a shield. Its ground speed is 5, and it’s
trained in Endurance and Intimidate.</p>

<p>The soldier’s basic (and only) attack is the <strong>longsword</strong>, which does average
damage for its level and marks for a turn. Its <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong> heals it
for 14 HP when used.</p>

<p>The warforged isn’t too different from a human fighter, but its racial traits
give significantly more staying power. You can slap them onto any human stat
block to get the warforged version. If you use them in a tight formation then
most of them will get the +1 Battlefield Tactics bonus all the time when
attacking targets directly in front of the formation.</p>

<h3 id="warforged-captain">Warforged Captain</h3>

<p>This is a Level 6 Soldier (Leader) with 72 HP and all common warforged
traits. Its speed is 5 due to armor and its Warforged Resolve heals it for 18 HP
when used.</p>

<p>Captains fight with a Reach 2 <strong>glaive</strong>, which does average damage and marks for a
turn. It can use this weapon to performa <strong>Tactical Switch</strong> maneuver (recharge
4-6), in which it makes a basic attack that also slides the target 1 square. If
this hits, the captain or an ally within 10 squares can also shift 1 square.</p>

<p>Captains excel at fighting from the back row of that warforged soldier
formation, since they have a reach weapon. Tactical Switch is good for
disrupting enemy formations, or interrrupting flanking attempts by individual
strikers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a single sample encounter: Level 4, three human guards, 1 warforged
soldier, and 1 warforged captain. A mixed force that makes it look like
warforged make up the command and elite in this particular army.</p>

<p>Mechanically, these Monster Manual warforged are very simple and present little
in the way of exciting surprises other than the fact that they
will. Not. Stay. Down. If I’m being honest the book might have done without them
entirely.</p>

<p>However, I absolutely love the <em>concept</em> of warforged, both as player characters
and as NPCs. I love them so much I adapted them to GURPS <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">here</a>. I understand
why the first MM included these: the Eberron books were still a little ways
away, and the authors might have felt its fans needed a little reassurance.</p>
