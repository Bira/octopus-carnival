<p>Another original monster!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The largest human settlement in the Vale in our narrative present is the city of
Fallcrest, which is more or less exactly in its center and connected by roads to
the other major towns. It’s a big point of light, but the darkness starts just
beyond it. Those roads are dangerous, and even the areas just outside the city’s
walls contain their own threats.</p>

<p>Take the Moon Hills, for example, which are just to the south of the city. On
the blackest of nights, a fearsome beast is said to roam the hills and moors of
that region, hunting the unwary. No one has ever seen the Dark Drake and lived
to tell the tale - its existence is only known by the gruesome remains it leaves
behind.</p>

<p>The Dark Drake is in some ways Fallcrest’s pet monster, as it features in many
stories told in taverns or to children. These tales attribute all sorts of weird
abilities to it, and also talk about its extensive brood. These “lesser” drakes
<em>have</em> been frequently spotted in the area, and they’re also clearly more
dangerous and malignant than simple natural animals, but the Dark Drake itself
has remained elusive for decades, evading even experienced monster
hunters. Serious scholars dismiss it as just a myth. It doesn’t help that
opportunists from Fallcrest sometimes stage hoaxes to make a buck or cover up a
more mundane murder. Nevertheless, these smaller drakes and hoaxes can’t explain
<em>all</em> the bodies found on the Moon Hills.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The entries below assume that the Drake does indeed exist, and that it has some
connection to its “brood”. You are likely to find them together. They’re all
Natural Beasts with the Reptile keyword. As a reminder, “Natural” only means
it’s native to the middle world, and “Beast” means it looks and behaves like an
animal. We’re still dealing with a weird mystical creature here.</p>

<h3 id="dark-drake-of-the-moon-hills">Dark Drake of the Moon Hills</h3>

<p>The Drake itself is Large, and a Level 8 Elite Lurker with 148 HP. That’s a hell
of a thing to meet just outside the Vale’s premier “starting town”. It has
Darkvision and a speed of 6. Its basic <strong>Bite</strong> is quite strong for a lurker,
and it can use <strong>Double Attack</strong> to bite twice in an action. Instead of biting,
it can use the <strong>Ghost Drake</strong> ability to gain insubstantial and phasing for a
turn, move its speed, and then become invisible until the end of the encounter
or until after it makes an attack.</p>

<p>Being invisible allows the Dark Drake to use its <strong>Unseen Killer</strong> power, a
melee attack that targets Will and does heavy psychic damage - about double that
of a bite. It can also use its <strong>Terrible Aspect</strong> as a weapon, a minor-action
melee attack against Will that pushes the target 1 square and immobilizes them
for a turn. This recharges whenever the drake hits with any of its other
attacks.</p>

<p>The Dark Drake can sustain the same damage output whether it decides to stand
and fight or to employ the more lurkerish tactic of alternating Ghost Drake and
Unseen Killer. The latter is still a bit better since as a lurker its defenses
and HP are a bit low for its level.</p>

<h3 id="hellghost-dark-drake">Hellghost Dark Drake</h3>

<p>One of the two “dark brood” stat blocks we get in this entry. Hellghosts are
Large Natural Beasts and Level 6 Brutes with 85 HP. It has Darkvision, a Speed
of 8, and Fire Resistance 5. It projects an aura of <strong>Ghostfire Radiance</strong> (1)
that makes creatures inside Vulnerable 5 to fire. I wonder how that interacts
with a tiefling’s natural resistance.</p>

<p>The creature uses a <strong>Fiery Bite</strong> as its basic attack, which deals heavy fire
damage even before you account for the aura. Once per encounter it can use
<strong>Ghostfire Rampage</strong>, which is a standard “trample” ability: the drake moves
its speed and can cross enemy spaces. Every time it does so, it makes an attack
against that enemy. On a hit, it deals fire damage, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Also once per encounter, when the drake is immobilized, restrained, or stunned,
it can use <strong>Pulsing Ghostfire</strong> to attack a Close Burst 2. On a hit it deals
fire damage and knocks the target prone, on a miss it still deals half damage.</p>

<h3 id="adderbrood-dark-drake">Adderbrood Dark Drake</h3>

<p>This one is highly venomous. It’s a Medium Natural Beast, and a Level 7
Skirmisher with 79 HP. Its <strong>bite</strong> deals poison damage and slows for a turn.
It can attack these slowed targets with a <strong>Venomous Strike</strong> that deals the
same amount of poison damage and inflicts ongoing poison damage (save
ends). After the first failed save, the victim also becomes immobilized. A
successful save clears both this and the ongoing damage.</p>

<p><strong>Adder’s Mobility</strong> ensures that enemies slowed or immobilized by the drake
cannot make opportunity attacks against it, and that the drake can enter their
spaces. So it can, say, bite a defender and move through them to reach the
squishies.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The Drake’s lore sounds a bit commonplace at first, and its stats while
mechanically interesting are far from the most powerful thing we’ll see even in
this book… but the full impact of it all hits when you look at a map of the
Nentir Vale.</p>

<p>If you’re starting a campaign in the Nentir Vale, there’s a very high chance
that Fallcrest will be your PC’s starting home base. It’s big enough to offer
all the standard services, and it’s centrally located so they have plenty of
choice of where to adventure. The only reason not to start here is if the GM has
a more specific campaign or module in mind.</p>

<p>And the Moon Hills are right beside it, to the south. The road connecting
Fallcrest and the Harkenwold goes through them! If you still hold any notion of
D&amp;D being “like a MMO” that demands every fight be “fair” after reading this
far, this is where you drop them. A MMO would surround the starting town with
low-level trash enemies you can grind for levels. This book puts a level 8 elite
newbie-killer where those would be.</p>

<p>If deployed by a cruel GM against Level 1-2 players, the Drake is a terrifying
threat they must escape from. It can kill a PC in one round of attacks no matter
which approach it chooses. Against a party of experienced monster hunters who
are closer to it in level, you’ll want to deploy the Drake alongside some of its
brood to make a proper boss fight.</p>

<p>Goblins have always been in the game, as we already know. This is a specific
group of them operating in the southern regions of the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Between the Witchlight Fens and the Harken Forest, roughly on the south-central
region of the Vale, there is a hidden fort named Daggerburg. It belongs to a
large band of goblin brigands, who ride out of it to raid and pillage the
surrounding area. Their operation is quite successful because they’re far away
from the territories of more powerful monsters, and because their very diverse
membership has been extensively trained in guerrilla tactics by their leader
Delderosh.</p>

<p>The band also includes a number of remarkable individuals beyond Delderosh
himself. There’s Kabo Bomble, a massive bruiser nearly twice the size of a
typical goblin; and there are the Mistmane Bugbears, a cult who trains in a
fighting style that combines unarmed combat and necromantic magic.</p>

<p>Delderosh really hates enemy spellcasters and likes collecting their eyeballs as
trophies. He likes spellcasters just fine when they’re working for him, though,
which is why he’s allied to the necromancer Gokof (from the Cadaver Collector
entry) and has several war mages on his payroll.</p>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins have become more daring of late, and have been pushing
deeper into the Harkenwold region north of the Harken forest, even going so far
as to raid settlements. However they haven’t yet worked up the courage to strike
at the Woodsinger elves who also live in the same region.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Daggerburg gang tends to be a cut above your standard MM/MV goblins, their
levels covering the latter half of the Heroic Tier instead of the earlier
one. Most of them also have at least one of the following signature abilities
representing their training:</p>

<p><strong>Combat Adept</strong> gives them a +1d10 damage bonus against enemies who haven’t yet
acted this combat. Anyone with this trait really likes rolling high for
initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Daggerburg Tactics</strong> replaces the generic Goblin Tactics trait. When a
creature with this is missed by a melee attack, the attacker grants combat
advantage to them in this next turn.</p>

<h3 id="battle-worg">Battle Worg</h3>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins raise a distinctive breed of giant wolf for use as mounts
in battle. Despite being called “battle worgs”, they’re not sapient like
standard worgs, and are a little weaker. Their mechanics are still similar,
though.</p>

<p>Battle Worgs are Large Natural Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP and
a speed of 8. Their <strong>Frigthful Growls</strong> acts as an aura (1) that inflicts a -1
to-hit penalty on enemies caught inside. Their mount trait is <strong>Slavering
Lunge</strong>, which lets the worg move half its speed as a free action when their
rider rolls initiative. Their reach 1 <strong>Bite</strong> damages and inflicts ongoing 5
damage (save ends).</p>

<p>A lot of the people who could use battle worgs as mounts in this entry are
higher level than them, but it’s a simple enough task to level up the worgs to
match their riders if you want them to last longer in the fight.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-ruffian">Daggerburg Ruffian</h3>

<p>An experienced raider, this goblin is a Level 4 Soldier with 58 HP and a speed
of 5. It’s armored in mail, wields a light shield and spear combo in melee, and
a light crossbow for ranged combat. It has both Combat Adept and Daggerburg
Tactics.</p>

<p>The <strong>spear</strong> and <strong>crossbow</strong> are used in basic attacks, and the spear can also
<strong>trip up</strong> an enemy, doing the same damage as a basic attack and knocking the
target prone.</p>

<p>Ruffians are perfect riders for the battle worgs we just saw.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-theurge">Daggerburg Theurge</h3>

<p>Theurges seem to be goblin spellcasters with a witchy theme. They’re Level 5
Controllers with 64 HP and both signature traits. They’re listed as Medium, but
should be Small instead.</p>

<p>They fight in melee with <strong>spiked clubs</strong>, and once per encounter they can call
down a <strong>Brimstone Rain</strong> that works as an area burst 2 attack. It deals
immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends), half on a miss.</p>

<p>Their most fun power, however, is the at-will <strong>Slimy Transformation</strong>. Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude, does no damage, but <em>turns the target into a frog</em> (save ends)!
This is a mundane Tiny frog, not a giant variety. Frogged targets are considered
slowed, and can’t use powers - not even basic attacks. The only limitation here
is that the theurge can’t cast this on someone who’s already transformed by it.</p>

<p>So yeah, they are sure to open up with Brimstone Rain and then stay away
applying the Transformation to as many PCs as possible while their buddies do
the actual damage.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-war-mage">Daggerburg War Mage</h3>

<p>Another mage, this one a more straighforward hobgoblin elemental adept. It’s
Level 6 Artillery with 58 HP. They have Combat Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics.</p>

<p>War mages fight with their <strong>staffs</strong>, which also work as implements. At range
they can hit you with an at-will <strong>Stabbing Flame</strong> that does immediate and
ongoing fire damage, or with a recharge 5+ <strong>Icy Stream</strong> that does cold damage
and slides the target 3 squares.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-slayer">Daggerburg Slayer</h3>

<p>A beefy hobgoblin with a big axe. It’s a Level 6 Brute with 85 HP. It has Combat
Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics. Their <strong>greataxe</strong> is their sole attack, but
it has some riders: it deals +5 damage while the slayer is bloodied, and it
deals another +5 damage if the strike bloodies the target.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the slayer can use its <strong>Hobgoblin Resilience</strong> to
immediately roll a save against an (save ends) effect as a reaction.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-zealot">Daggerburg Zealot</h3>

<p>A bugbear trained with the glaive. Not one of the Mistmanes, those are
below. Zealots are Level 7 Skirmishers with 78 HP. They have Combat Adept.</p>

<p>The <strong>glaive</strong> is a solid Reach 2 basic attack and their <strong>Mobile Attack</strong>
ability allows them to shift half their speed and make a glaive attack at any
point during the movement. Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of
the zealot attacks one of its allies, the zealot can use <strong>Dagerburg Zealotry</strong>
shift up to 5 squares and hit the attacker with its glaive as a reaction.</p>

<p>A very mobile combatant with a reach weapon, who will use both of these things
to get at the party’s back lines and mess up their squishies.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-captain">Daggerburg Captain</h3>

<p>This hobgoblin officer probably serves directly under Delderosh. It’s a Level 7
Soldier (Leader) with 78 HP. The captain is clad in mail and wields a bastard
sword and a shield.</p>

<p>The <strong>bastard sword</strong> makes attacks that damage and mark for a turn. While the
mark persists, the target also grants combat advantage. Once per encounter, and
once again after it’s first bloodied, the captain can yell <strong>Follow Me!</strong> and
charge an enemy. Two allies within 5 squares of its starting position can then
make a free charge against different enemies.</p>

<p>The captain has none of the signature traits from the start of this
section. Instead, it has an improved version of Hobgoblin Resilience named
<strong>Daggerburg Resilience</strong>, which works the same but can be applied either to the
captain or to an ally within 5 squares of it.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-reaper">Daggerburg Reaper</h3>

<p>A hobgoblin who specializes in the use of the scythe. It’s a Level 7 Lurker with
64 HP. The <strong>scythe</strong> can make decent basic attacks, and once per encounter the
reaper can use a <strong>Blinding Sweep</strong> that targets a Close Burst 1, deals heavy
damage, and blinds for a turn on a hit. A miss does half damage.</p>

<p>As a move action, the reaper can <strong>Stalk</strong>, which allows it to shift 1 square
and then move its speed. If it ends in a space at least three squares from any
other creatures, it becomes invisible until the start of its next turn or until
it makes an attack.</p>

<p>These abilities are interesting but the reaper has no powers that specifically
exploit them. It’s a very skirmishery lurker.</p>

<h3 id="mistmane-bugbear">Mistmane Bugbear</h3>

<p>These bugbear adepts received their name from the constant misty aura they
project, which disrupts teleportation and can confuse enemies’ minds. Their
claws are laced with necromantic energy. They’re Large Natural Humanoids and
Level 8 Elite Soldiers with 172 HP.</p>

<p>They have Combat Adept, and their <strong>Arcane Mist</strong> aura (2) prevents creatures
from teleporting as mentioned above. Their basic attack is a <strong>Rake</strong> with their
claws, which damages and marks for a turn. If a marked enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t target the bugbear, they take 5 necrotic damage. As elites, they
can use this for <strong>Double Attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>Once per encounter as a minor action they can use the <strong>Bewildering Mist</strong>
ability, attacking the Will of every enemy in a Close Burst 1. A hit dazes the
target for a turn.</p>

<p>Mistmanes are excellent front-line fighters, able to keep two PCs marked at
once.</p>

<h3 id="kabo-bomble">Kabo Bomble</h3>

<p>One of the Daggerburg gang’s champions, Kabo Bomble is a giant of a goblin,
twice as tall as the typical member of the species. This puts him well into
Medium size. He fights with a morningstar in one hand and a spiked gauntlet in
the other. Kabo is a Level 9 Brute with 116 HP. He has both Combat Adept and
Daggerburg Tactics.</p>

<p>Kabo’s <strong>morningstar</strong> and <strong>gauntlet</strong> do about the same damage, with the first
being a basic attack and the second targetting Reflex and dazing for a turn on a
critical hit.</p>

<p>Twice per encounter, Kabo can use a <strong>Furious Attack</strong> ability to attack with
both weapons in a single action. If both hit the same target, it is dazed for a
turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, Kabo Bomble can <strong>Roar</strong> as a minor action, attacking the
Will of all enemies in a Close Burst 2 and inflicting a -2 defense penalty on a
hit (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="warlord-delderosh">Warlord Delderosh</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-daggerburg-delderosh.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Delderosh is the leader of the Daggerburg Goblins, and is likely to be found
leading their biggest raids or at the center of Daggerburg itself surrounded by
his personal guard. This hobgoblin is a Level 10 Skirmisher (Leader) with 200
HP.</p>

<p>Delderosh’s custom traits are <strong>Ambush Leader</strong>, which gives a +5 to the
Initiative rolls of every ally within 5 squares of him at the start of the
fight; and <strong>Combat Advantage</strong>, which gives him some bonus damage when he has
that against a target.</p>

<p>Delderosh carries a <strong>spear</strong> for fighting in melee and a <strong>shortbow</strong> for
ranged attacks. The spear attack allows him to shift 1 square as an effect and
it can be used to <strong>Skewer</strong> (recharge 5+), which deals the same damage as a
basic attack and inflicts ongoing 10 damage (save ends). As an effect, it also
makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, he has the same <strong>Daggerburg Resilience</strong> reaction power as the
Captains working under him.</p>

<p>The warlord is depicted riding a battle worg here and he would certainly benefit
from the thing’s traits, but you’ll likely need to increase the level of his
personal mount from the base 5. Everyone else in the encounter where he appears
should have Combat Adept to maximize the benefit they get from his initiative
bonus.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins don’t differ much in concept from the “generic” band of
goblin brigands, but they’re a very nice worked example of the trope, with
several memorable named NPCs. They also show us how to stretch classic
goblinoids into a threat that can keep PCs occupied for the whole of the heroic
tier.</p>

<p>The band might get involved in factional conflicts with the Iron Circle, a
foreign mercenary army that has been moving into Harkenwold. And the druids of
Harken’s Heart would be among the groups they avoid. Both of these get their own
entries later on.</p>

            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is an original entry about a specific group of antagonists.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Clan Bloodspear is a large clan of orcs who make their home in the Stonemarch, a
desolate region to the northwest of the Nentir Vale, separated from it by the
Cairngorm Peaks. From what I understand, they’re pretty well adapted to it and
don’t really need to raid their neighbors for resources. However, Gruumsh still
exerts his divine influence to make sure they form a huge horde and ravage the
surrounding lands about once every century.</p>

<p>The clan was founded by the eponymous King Bloodspear, who in the distant past
slew the elder dragon Kulkozsar in single combat and made a throne of his
skull. The glory from his deed attracted many followers, and they made the
dragon’s former lair into an entire underground city that kept being expanded
and improved over time. In our narrative present it includes multiple forges,
arenas, and slave pens. Their technology and production base is significantly
higher than that of other orc clans, though they still rely on slave labor to
power a lot of it.</p>

<p>The last time the Bloodspear marched forth was ninety years ago, when they
attacked Nentir Vale and practically erased the civilizations within it. The
land and its inhabitants have yet to fully recover from that attack, and yet it
seems they’re getting ready to do it again. Gruumsh has selected a new champion
among the Bloodspear, and that champion is hard at work in forging them into an
invading army.</p>

<p>In an uncharacteristic move for the patriarchal Bloodspear, this new champion is
a woman: Queen Msuga. She’s an extremely formidable warrior and general, and has
defeated enough challengers to her legitimacy that all of them now accept her
rule. Msuga is always accompanied by her sister Rohka, who is also known as the
Blood Witch. As a high priest of Gruumsh, she commands vast mystical powers
despite her withered body. Some rumors say Rohka is the true power behind the
throne and Msuga is just a puppet. Whatever the truth is, it’s clear the two
sisters are united in purpose.</p>

<p>And this purpose is an ambitious one: the sisters are preparing not to simply
raid the Nentir Vale, but to conquer and annex it as part of their nascent
Bloodspear Empire.</p>

<p>In addition to their powerful leaders and their large numbers of combat-ready
orcs, Clan Bloodspear also contains a small but significant percentage of
individuals of mixed orc and troll or ogre descent. The book described this as a
“breeding program” overseen by Rohka and calls the results “vile half-breeds”,
but I don’t like this language at all and would probably explain it as a natural
consequence of them sharing space with ogres and trolls over on the Stonemarch.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Clan Bloodspear would mostly be made up of orcs fitting the standard profiles
listed on the Monster Vault, but they also have some combat traditions that are
unique to them. We also get stat blocks for the half-troll and half-ogre
(ogrillon) members of the clan. You could conceivably add full-blooded ogres and
trolls to their numbers as well.</p>

<p>As a reminder, orcs are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6 and Low-light
vision. Their signature trait is <strong>Savage Demise</strong>, which lets them take a
standard action for free when they hit 0 HP. Some of the stat blocks here play
with that standard template a bit, and I’ll point out when they do so.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-grenadier">Bloodspear Grenadier</h3>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>The Bloodspear like their explosives! Grenadiers are Level 4 Artillery with 44
HP. They carry 2 <strong>handaxes</strong> to fight in melee or to throw, and 4 <strong>fire
bombs</strong> that act as area burst 1 attacks and deal fire damage. Once per
encounter when an enemy ends their movement adjacent to the grenadier, they can
shift 2 squares and drop a load of <strong>caltrops</strong> in a close blast 3 pattern. This
creates a zone that damages anyone who enters it or ends its turn inside.</p>

<p>Grenadiers replace Savage Demise with <strong>Blazing Fury</strong>, which deals 5 fire
damage to all adjacent creatures and lets them throw a fire bomb for free.</p>

<p>I guess if these grenadiers manage to use up all of their ammo, they’ll
probably retreat from the fight, since the Bloodspear are supposed to be a
well-coordinated and more disciplined force than your standard orc band. You
might want to add a feature like a supply cart to the battlefield that would
allow them to reload, and would also be very flammable.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-krull">Bloodspear Krull</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-krull.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Krulls are named after a famous 80s fantasy movie that featured a weapon called
a Glaive, because they are Bloodspear martial artists who specialize in
glaives. That’s it. That’s the joke.</p>

<p>The “glaive” from the movie was a cool throwing star thing, but the weapon
Bloodspear Krulls use is the equally cool <em>real</em> glaive, a polearm with a
single-edged sword blade at the end. They’re Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>glaive</strong> can be used to make strong Reach 2 basic attacks, and it can also
be used in a <strong>Charging Sweep</strong> (recharge 6+) maneuver. This is a Close Burst 2
attack that deals the same damage as a basic attack, pushes targets it hits 1
square, and knocks them prone. As the name implies, it can be used as part of a
charge.</p>

<p>When the krull bloodies an enemy, its <strong>Frenzied Strike</strong> ability allows it to
make a free extra attack against that enemy. And when they drop to 0 HP, their
<strong>Charging Demise</strong> ability lets them recharge and immediately use Charging
Sweep one last time.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-ogrillon">Bloodspear Ogrillon</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-ogrillon.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Orgillons are half-orc/half-ogres. They’re smaller and smarter than a full ogre,
and almost as strong. These are Level 5 Elite Brutes with 156 HP.</p>

<p>Orgillons fight bare-handed. Their <strong>slams</strong> do strong physical damage, and do
bonus damage against prone targets. On a critical hit, they knock the target
prone as well. As elites they can make <strong>Double Attacks</strong>. They lack a Demise
ability, but their <strong>Brutish Retaliation</strong> allows them to use a slam against an
enemy in reach that hits them with a ranged or area attack as a reaction. This
sounds a bit redundant when these attacks already provoke opportunity attacks,
but it at least lets the ogrillon save their opportunity action to attack
someone else. Or to hit the offender again when they try to move away after
landing that attack.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-shiv">Bloodspear Shiv</h3>

<p>Skilled knife-fighters, shivs are Level 6 Skirmishers with 75 HP. They carry no
less than 12 <strong>daggers</strong>, which can be used in melee or thrown. Their <strong>Shifting
Shank</strong> ability lets them shift their speed and make a dagger attack at any
point during the movement. If this attack bloodies the target, they can make a
second free attack against that target.</p>

<p>They have the standard <strong>Savage Demise</strong> ability as well.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-half-troll">Bloodspear Half-Troll</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-half-troll.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Like ogrillons, half-trolls are smaller and smarter than their troll parent, and
almost as strong. They also retain the infamous trollish regeneration
abilities. They are Level 8 Soldiers with 92 HP.</p>

<p>Half trolls have Regeneration 5 and Troll Healing, which lets them rise again
with 11 HP a turn after they drop. Acid or fire damage can prevent them from
healing for a turn, and can prevent them from rising.</p>

<p>The half-troll’s <strong>claws</strong> damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 16), and it can
grab up to two creatures at once. If a grabbed creature attacks the half-troll
or escapes the grab, the half-troll can <strong>bite</strong> them as a reaction, an attack
that deals light physical damage. It also has the standard version of Savage
Demise, which could potentially trigger several times during the battle if the
PCs are too slow with their acid and fire.</p>

<h3 id="bloodspear-savage-throng">Bloodspear Savage Throng</h3>

<p>A large unit of orcs with an unfortunate name, for use during the late Heroic
tier. It’s a Huge Swarm of Medium Natural Humanoids, and a Level 9 Brute with
117 HP. It follows all the standard swarm rules: half damage from single-target
attacks, 10 extra damage from area attacks, can occupy the same space as other
characters, and can move through any opening big enough for a single Medium
creature.</p>

<p>The throng’s <strong>swarm attack</strong> aura (1) is relatively weak, inflicting only 4
damage on anyone caught inside. As it also occupies the swarm’s own spaces,
though, it covers plenty of squares. Its basic attack is a <strong>Mob of Swinging
Axes</strong>, and once per encounter it can pull off a <strong>Savage Frenzy</strong> that attacks
every enemy in a Clost Burst 1, doing half damage on a miss. As with the aura,
the burst should also catch anyone who is inside the swarm.</p>

<p>Once at the start and once when first bloodied, the throng can make a
<strong>Trample</strong> maneuver, which works as usual: move their speed and make an attack
against any enemy whose space they move through. The attack deals physical
damage and knocks prone.</p>

<h3 id="queen-msuga">Queen Msuga</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-msuga.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Msuga is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with the Leader keyword and 212 HP. Her usual
speed of 6 becomes 8 when she charges. If the PCs fight her, she will surely be
alongside her sister Rohka and a sizable honor guard.</p>

<p>Msuga’s <strong>greataxe</strong> marks the target for a turn on a hit, and she can perform a
<strong>Sweeping Blade</strong> (recharge 5+) maneuver that attacks every enemy in a Close
Burst 1 for more damage than a basic attack, and even more against bloodied
enemies. This also marks everyone it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>As a minor action, she can use <strong>Furious Onslaught</strong> to order an ally within 10
squares to charge or make a basic attack as a free action. If a marked enemy
within 5 squares makes an attack that doesn’t target her, she can shift 5
squares to make a greataxe attack aggainst the offender as a reaction.</p>

<p>When Msuga drops to 0 HP, <strong>Queen’s Demise</strong> allows her or an ally within 10
squares to use a standard action for free.</p>

<h3 id="rohka-the-blood-witch">Rohka the Blood Witch</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-rohka.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As mentioned above, Rohka is most likely to be found alongside her sister Msuga,
and accompanied by a sizable honor guard besides. She is a Level 10 Elite
Controller with 216 HP. She has the usual ground speed of 6 and an effective
teleport speed of 10.</p>

<p>Rohka fights in melee with her <strong>claws</strong>, but she prefers to stay at range and
fling spells. Her go-to is <strong>Chaos Displacement</strong>, an area burst attack that
targets Fortitude, deals psychic damage, and slides targets 3 squares. Every so
often she can use the <strong>Baleful Eye of Gruumsh</strong> (recharge 5+), which targets 1
or 2 creatures and attacks Will. A hit deals psychic damage and slows (save
ends). After the first failed save this worsens to immobilization, and after the
second failure the target is dominated instead.</p>

<p>If someone hits Rohka with a melee or ranged attack and an ally is nearby, she
can use <strong>I Need a Volunteer</strong> (encounter) to teleport and swap places with the
ally as an interrupt, making the attack target the ally instead of her. This
does mean the attack could <em>miss</em> the ally if their defenses are higher. She
also has the standard version of Savage Demise.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Overall I like this portrayal of Clan Bloodspear. They make a solid choice for
opposition because they’re ambitious and highly militarized imperialists with a
penchant for enslaving others. In fact, they make me think of Rome’s mythical
founding, since they’re led by two divinely-chosen siblings who are setting out
to build an empire where before there was “nothing” (i.e, a bunch of
civilizations who were minding their own business and were made targets for
invasion).</p>

<p>Combining the stat blocks from this entry with the standard orc stats in the MV
gives you enough opposition to last you the whole Heroic tier. The book still
uses the word “savage” a little too often for my tastes, and there’s the “vile
half-breeds” thing, but I intend to change this if I ever use them in a game.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>When someone in the Nentir Vale points behind you and shouts “Look out, a
three-headed dragon!” you should <em>always look</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I mentioned in earlier posts that the Vale was first settled by people from
Nerath about three hundred years ago, and that the first area they settled is
now known as the Old Hills.</p>

<p>What we hadn’t learned yet was that this settlement process was far from
peaceful. Back then, the Dawnforge mountains that make up the Vale’s eastern
border were home to a small community of chromatic dragons who considered all
they saw to be their domain. The first few attempts by human settlers to build
villages in the Old Hills were thwarted by dragon attacks, with great loss of
life and material.</p>

<p>It was only when the settlers asked the dwarves for help that they succeeded in
establishing a foothold. The next wave came accompanied by a sizable dwarven
military force, which was quick to build the fortress of Hammerfast and use it
as a base to fight off the dragons. It didn’t take long for them to meet the
creature that was ultimately behind these attacks: Calastryx, the three-headed
red dragon.</p>

<p>Calastryx was too powerful for even the dwarven army to defeat, but they gave
the wizard Starris enough time to cast a curse upon the dragon, placing her in a
slumber that was supposed to be eternal. This allowed Nerath to finally settle
the Vale, and Hammerfast to eventually grow into one of its major cities. To
this day, no one knows the dragon’s history or why she has three heads. Does she
suffer from a genetic or magical mutation? Is she the creation of a cruel god or
of some other entity? Answers are thin on the ground, but your PCs just might
get the chance to ask her.</p>

<p>You see, that curse held strong for three centuries but it’s starting to
weaken. It’s possible Calastryx will awaken in the near future. The region of
the Dawnforge mountains where her lair used to be is currently inhabited by the
Emberdark kobold tribe, who have their own share of historical beefs with the
Hammerfast dwarves. Their priests have begun receiving visions from Kurtulmak,
one of Tiamat’s Exarchs, speaking of Calastryx’s imminent awakening. The kobolds
have starting raiding nearby travelers and settlements with the aim of
gathering a treasure trove they’ll use to bribe their future mistress into
accepting their loyalty. You can already see some of their warriors wearing
shoulder pads that mimic extra heads, in honor of Calastryx.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The star of the show here is clearly Calastryx, but we also get a stat block for
an Emberdark-specific kobold that you can mix in with the standard kobold stat
blocks.</p>

<h3 id="emberdark-kobold-pillager">Emberdark Kobold Pillager</h3>

<p>Apparently the Emberdark are pretty fond of fire, because this kobold here is
something of a fire-themed paladin of Tiamat. It’s a Level 4 Soldier with 55 HP
which, given the usual kobold level range, makes it one of their most powerful
champions. It has Speed 6 and Darkvision.</p>

<p>The pillager fights with a <strong>Flamebiter Spear</strong> that deals fire damage, marks
for a turn, and makes it so targets that ignore the mark take 5 fire
damage. They can also cast <strong>Fire Dart</strong> spells that do fire damage and mark for
a turn, though they don’t have a “punisher” rider attached to them.</p>

<p>When the pillager hits 0 HP, it goes out in a <strong>Blaze of Glory</strong>, making one
final spear attack as a free action.</p>

<p>I would probably turn the “take fire damage if you ignore the mark” rider from
the spear into a trait that applies to both attacks, because things can get
fiddly if you have to remember if a mark from the pillager has it or not.</p>

<h3 id="calastryx">Calastryx</h3>

<p>Our star is a Huge Natural Magical Beast (Dragon) and a Level 14 Solo Brute with
684 HP. Level-wise she’s an adult red, but her actual stats differ quite heavily
from the standard dragon template.</p>

<p>She still has the standard draconic <strong>Action Recovery</strong> trait that ends any
dazing, stunning or dominating effect on her at the end of her turn. The new bit
here is that her <strong>Multiple Heads</strong> give her <em>three</em> turns per round, at fixed
initiative counts of 30, 20, and 10. The only limitation here is that she cannot
delay or ready actions (something monsters rarely do in my experience) and she
only has one set of immediate actions between these turns.</p>

<p>Her Reach 3 <strong>bites</strong> damage and slide 3 squares. Her <strong>Breath Weapon</strong>
(recharge 6+) does light fire damage, half on a miss, and creates a damaging
fire zone for a turn. She can also fire single-target <strong>Inferno Shots</strong> at will
to deal heavy fire damage. Finally, <strong>Rip and Tear</strong> is an encounter power that
allows her to bite up to three targets for slightly less damage than the basic
bite.</p>

<p>These actions seem a little weak, and they indeed are, fit more for a regular
monster than a solo. But remember that Calastryx get three full turns per round
to use them in. Each of her heads has a fully independent mind and they’re in
perfect coordination. The <strong>Power of Three</strong> means each of them tracks their
Breath Weapon and Rip and Tear powers separately. So she actually gets three
uses of Rip and Tear per encounter, and three independently recharging uses of
her breath weapon.</p>

<p>Once she is first bloodied, Calastryx immediately grows a <em>fourth</em> head, which
from then on acts on initiative 40 with its own independently tracked breath
weapon and encounter power.</p>

<p>Calastryx might be much more wrathful than your typical red dragon, but she’s
still very smart. She will fight the PCs in places where she can herd them into
tight spaces to ensure they’re all hit by her breath weapons and bites.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Calastryx shows us how far we can stretch the mechanics and still end up with
something that feels like a dragon, and I love her for it. Story-wise she’s
pretty much your standard slumbering kaiju. She could be an awesome final boss
for a campaign that ends at level 10, or a memorable “welcoming gift” for PCs
who just made it to paragon tier.</p>

<p>A lengthier campaign focusing on Calastryx could present the threat of her
awakening early, and have its early conflicts be against the Emberdark
kobolds. It might even be possible to reach a diplomatic resolution with them
and get them onboard as allies against Calastryx when she finally awakens. I
mean, your typical dragon already doesn’t have a great track record of treating
its kobold lackeys very well, and Calastryx is even less inclined to do so no
matter the size of the tribute they present her with.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I saw these in a 3e supplement somewhere, but there’s a nifty
bonus stat block here that ties them to the Nentir Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cadaver Collectors are specialized constructs first built by ancient
necromancers to provide them with a supply of corpses. Their metal-plated bodies
are covered in long spikes that they use to impale collected corpses for
transport and delivery. They were commonly sent to “clear” battlefields after a
battle had ended.</p>

<p>Like many other constructs they’re pretty good at performing the job they were
designed for and at following instructions related to it, but they can’t do
anything else well. This is why no one sent them to fight in those battles. They
only follow the orders of their current master, or those of a person who also
serves that master.</p>

<p>The original recipe for cadaver collectors was repeatedly lost and rediscovered
over the ages. No one in the Nentir Vale knows how to build one in our narrative
present, but there are several old ones still around in the wild. Many of them
are located somewhere within the Witchlight Fens, a swampy region in the
south-central Vale.</p>

<p>When a collector’s master dies it will usually fulfill the last order it was
given and then stand by waiting for more. If someone happens to die in their
assigned area in the meantime, they will dutifully go out to collect the
bodies. If someone manages to convince the collector they work for the
collector’s master, the creature will obey their orders.</p>

<p>After enough time waiting for orders that never come, their programming might
mutate a bit, giving them a bit more initiative. Some collectors decide to go
looking for a new master to serve. Others decide to broaden their mission
parameters and consider living creatures valid targets for collection.</p>

<p>There’s a hobgoblin necromancer named Gokof living in the Witchlight Fens who is
unusually skilled at convincing ancient cadaver collectors to work for him. He’s
nominally a member of the Daggerburg goblin tribe but spends most of his time
away from them and in the company of his collectors and undead servants. He
rarely has more than two collectors working for him at any one time, but never
seems to have trouble finding more to replace them.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one for a cadaver collector and one for Gokof.</p>

<h3 id="cadaver-collector">Cadaver Collector</h3>

<p>These constructs are Large Natural Animates and Level 9 Elite Soldiers with 200
HP and a speed of 8. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have
Resist Lightning 10. They are somewhat weak to thunder damage: whenever they
take thunder damage, they become slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>Collectors attack with <strong>Slams</strong> that deal physical damage and grab on a hit
(escape DC 20). They can grab one Large creature or up to four Small creatures
at once. As an elite it can perform <strong>Double Slams</strong>.</p>

<p>The collector can also spend its action to <strong>Impale</strong> a grabbed creature. This
deals massive damage, pulls them into the collector’s space, restrains them, and
inflicts 10 ongoing damage (save ends all). When the collector moves, the
creature is pulled along, and when the effect ends, the creature reappears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that there’s a limit to how many creatures a collector
can <em>grab</em>, but not to how many it can <em>impale</em>. It’s not going to matter much
in practice, because it’s highly unlikely a collector will impale the whole
party at once. However, if it ever becomes relevant I’m inclined to say their
impaling limit is the same as the one for grabs. A fully loaded collector would
have four Medium cadavers impaled and another four grabbed. And would probably
have more than the two arms depicted in the illustration.</p>

<p>Finally, the collector can <strong>Trample</strong> once per encounter like the big chungus
it is. The rules are as usual: it moves its speed and can cross enemy spaces
while doing so, making an attack that deals heavy physical damage and knocks
prone against every enemy whose space they cross.</p>

<p>Collectors fight by pretty much applying their programming to the PCs. Grab
impale, repeat. When fully loaded, trample to retreat.</p>

<h3 id="gokof-hobgoblin-necromancer">Gokof, Hobgoblin Necromancer</h3>

<p>Gokof is a Level 9 Controller (Leader). He has speed 6 and low-light vision from
being a hobgoblin. He wields a <strong>Staff</strong> as both weapon and implement, and has
an array of necromantic spells at his disposal.</p>

<p>His basic ranged attack is a <strong>Necrotic Ray</strong> that deals necrotic damage on a
hit and slows for a turn as an effect. Anything that happens “as an effect”
always happens, regardless of whether the attack hits or not! Less often
(recharge 5+) he can cast <strong>Sapping Tendrils</strong> as a ranged area attack. This is
not selective, and on a hit it deals necrotic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Instead of casting a spell, Gokof can use <strong>Command Animate</strong> to order an
animate ally to make a melee basic attack as a free action. Cadaver collectors
are animates, of course, and so are a lot of undead.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of Gokof regains HP, the
necromancer can use <strong>Dark Healing</strong> to automatically deal them a chunk of
necrotic damage and recover 24 HP himself.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you think about it, the existence of cadaver collectors shows that necromancy
in D&amp;D requires an ideological commitment to the spread of undeath. These
constructs are more powerful and have a less ethically questionable nature than
most “servant” undead. They also take more skill to build, but their original
builders clearly <em>had</em> that skill. And yet chose to task their constructs with
collecting corpses for turning into zombies.</p>

<p>I like the addition of Gokof to this entry. It helps establish a concrete
situation where cadaver collectors appear in the Nentir Vale. It’s also an
example of how a less “ideological” necromancer would come to control these
creatures. This is more than even most other setting-specific monster books
do. Those usually just say “these monsters exist in this setting”.</p>
