<p>In my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/31/year-in-review.html">2016 in review</a> post I mentioned a GURPS X-COM play-by-forum game
which I unfortunately had to end mid-campaign that year. In this post I’ll talk
about it in more detail, because even though it didn’t reach its conclusion I
think a lot of things about it were great successes. Perhaps this knowledge can
help others, including Future Me when I try something like this again.</p>

<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>

<p>The setting was 2020 Earth, and the five-year difference was only there to give
me some chronological wiggle room. The original intent was to keep everything as
close to the real world as possible, other than the existence of X-COM and the
alien invaders. In fact, my mapping tool of choice for outdoor action sequences
were Google Maps and Google Earth!</p>

<p>My iteration of X-COM blends influences from several places, as you’ll see
below. The Council responsible for funding it is made up of the 36 nations
described at the end of <a href="http://xcom.wikia.com/wiki/The_Council">this page</a>. Its command and science staff were
NPCs, but I wasn’t entirely under control of who would take which position!</p>

<p>At the start of the campaign, before we even made characters, I gave the players
two choices for the position of Commander and three for the position of Lead
Scientist. They chose a character who was basically a Big Boss expy for
Commander, and an… eccentric Russian scientist named Yuri Sokolov, whose
specialty was in weird science.</p>

<p>The other two scientist choices were Dr. Vahlen and Dr. Shen from the original
game, and they stuck around as prominent NPCs despite not being the official
heads of research. The other Commander choice, a British spy named Smiley, went
into the cold and out of the game.</p>

<p>The players also got a choice of two different alien invasions, and I’ll talk
about them in more detail later.</p>

<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>

<h3 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h3>

<p>Player characters were built using 250 points, and preferably a GURPS Action
template. There were a few added restrictions. Highly cinematic advantages such
as Gunslinger were off-limits during character creation, tough there would be
opportunities to acquire them in play. Traits whose scope was limited to a
specific area of the world were also disallowed, since this would be a
globe-trotting campaign and they’d almost never come up. These mostly consisted
of social traits such as Contacts or Enemies.</p>

<p>The point total was dictated by their choice of commander, since the two of them
represented different popular strategies in the original games. Mr. Fox (“Big
Boss”) prefers to have a few very competent soldiers with extensive robot
support when that becomes available. Mr. Smiley would have gone with a large
number of relatively expendable soldiers, which would have led to teams of
150-point characters and several NPC redshirts.</p>

<p>The other main variant rule I used was the simplified Guns skills from <strong>Pyramid
#3/65</strong>, which I find a lot simpler to handle than the default spread.</p>

<h3 id="the-pcs">The PCs</h3>

<p>There was a bit of churn in my player and PC roster during the campaign, as is
the nature of forum games, but these characters showed up the most during the
entire run of the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid Hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China,
built without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness
and empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Julia was ran by three
different players during the lifetime of the campaign, which earns her a medal
for Most Helpful Backup Character.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame. Also built without a template. His player dropped out of the planet
near the end of the game, but not before making things <em>interesting</em> for the
rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>We had others, but they stayed for a shorter time than the four above. Several
actually never saw action as PCs, though Russian Shooter <strong>Vasily Valenkov</strong>
gets another medal for always being there for his teammates even with no player
to run him.</p>

<h3 id="the-organization">The Organization</h3>

<p>X-COM itself was also a character! Between field assignments, players stepped
out of their normal characters for a moment and moved to a “strategy” layer
where they made decisions that affected the organization as a whole. Since I
didn’t want to make this part <em>too</em> complex, it was mostly about deciding what
to research next.</p>

<p>Each strategic phase, the group got a certain number of “research points”
that depended on how well they had done in their previous mission and how
well-favored by the Council X-COM was. They allocated that between several
different research topics, most of which cost a single point at the time the
game stopped. A topic that was fully paid for would bear fruit in the form of
new technology by the time the PCs went on their next deployment.</p>

<h2 id="the-enemy">The Enemy</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, I gave the group a choice of enemy to fight. I wasn’t
very forthcoming with details during this particular part of the vote, of
course, as the whole point of an X-COM game is that the enemy is <em>unknown</em>. The
two were described mostly in terms of what their early signs were: <em>Lights in
the Sky</em> and <em>Noises in the Dark</em>. As you can guess by the title of this post,
the latter’s more mysterious nature won out in the end.</p>

<p>The <em>Lights in the Sky</em> invaders were pretty much the aliens from the original
games, mostly as shown there. I would have introduced some variation, but they
would still have been largely recognizable. I can’t really into more detail, as
this path wasn’t chosen and thus wasn’t developed.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I’m really glad the players chose to go with <em>Noises in the Dark</em>
because this meant I had the opportunity to pit X-COM against
the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">Dreams of Ruin</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow that link, you’ll arrive at a DrivethruRPG page for the book of
the same name, which had come out shortly before I started the game. I backed
its Kickstarter, and was dying to use it somewhere. I think this book is
probably the best thing to come out of the OSR, not the least because I don’t
<em>have</em> to use any OSR rules to run it. The good stuff is all system-agnostic and
the rest is relatively easy to convert. Go download it, it’s free!</p>

<p>The best summary I can give about the Dreams is that they are a weaponized
ecosystem that feeds on mundane evil and spreads the cosmic variety wherever it
goes.  Its creators in the book purposefully obscured their identity and simply
let the thing loose in the multiverse, but in this campaign it was being
purposefully deployed as a weapon. Instead of UFOs and sectoids, the PCs get to
deal with evil fungal trees and homicidal puppets.</p>

<p>The identity of the author of the Dreams is left mysterious in the book (unless
you have access to an obscure old edition of Deities &amp; Demigods, I guess), but I
needed slightly more concrete masters here if I wanted this to feel like
X-COM. I eventually settled on something that’s a mix between the original
Ethereals and the devils from the excellent <a href="http://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a>
comic. They were beings of congealed energy whose intellect and personality was
entirely provided by the masks they wore. The ones at the top of the hierarchy
wore black masks, with the progression going black -&gt; gold -&gt; green -&gt; red -&gt;
blue -&gt; white. Other species these Masters had subjugated also had these masks
imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Alien technology was largely based on <em>magic</em> instead of mundane engineering, as
every non-human species in the setting had natural “magic circuits” in their
bodies that could channel mystical energies. They used Ritual Path Magic quite
extensively, with their artifacts being products of enchantment despite looking
like advanced technology. The Dreams produced TL 4+5 gear for their servants,
and the masters of the Dreams used TL4+7 gear.</p>

<p>The PCs never met anyone higher in that hierarchy than a white-mask, aside from
this one rogue blue-masked alien who defected to their side in a mission and
helped with research. X-COM <em>was</em> able to learn the basics of magic before the
game ended, and use some effects in the form of the Technomagic described in
<strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology</strong>.</p>

<p>There was also not one but <em>two</em> extra factions in this war. One was a species
of snake-people from Nilfheim who acted as interdimensional smugglers and drug
dealers - they rode on the tails of the Dreams and preyed upon the worlds they
victimized, disguising themselves as natives. So yes, Kendall was right and
there were reptoid infiltrators everywhere. These took the place of the night
hags from the Dreams of Ruin book.</p>

<p>The other secondary enemy faction was a band of mercenaries and shady operators
run by Mr. Smiley, the commander they rejected at the start. He used funding
from corrupt elites from Council nations who weren’t satisfied with the way that
X-COM failed to cater to their interests and sought an alternative. Yes, this
organization was named X-ALT.</p>

<p>Not all of these aliens have corresponding GURPS stats, since many never
appeared in the actual game, but enough have them that I could make a future
post or two out of them. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="what-went-right">What Went Right</h2>

<p>In Noises in the Dark I put to use several things I learned from previous
attempts at running play-by-forum games, and tried several more. I’m happy to
say several of my riskier experiments were successes!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Giving the players a set of campaign-shaping choices at the start worked
pretty well! It made some of them a little more invested in the setting, and
more importantly gave <em>me</em> a lot of motivation to flesh those choices out once
they were made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “strategic layer” gimmick worked very well and was a very X-COM
thing. Players cared about the choices they made there and they genuinely
shaped future events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the tabletop format allowed for missions that were more
elaborate than was possible in the computer games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google Maps/Earth as a mapping tool was simply awesome! Players had a <em>very</em>
positive reaction to this one, as did I. It greatly enhanced the missions and
quickly led us to further enhance play by seeking extra real-world information
about the places in question. (“Is this a residential area? Let’s check by
seeing if there are any apartments to rent around there!”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monsters were suitably spooky, and encounters with them provided great
atmosphere. The group perceived their first Tree of Woe on Halloween (of
2015), which was serendipitous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better-and-why-it-ended">What Could Be Better (and Why It Ended)</h2>

<p>Sadly, not everything was perfect with that game. If it was, it would still be
going! So what didn’t work like I expected?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Overly elaborate fights don’t work so well in a GURPS play-by-forum game. I
usually roll everything myself and resolve up to 3 rounds before posting,
following general directions from the players. That, however, makes some
setups both exhausting to resolve and, I imagine, unsatisfying to read about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “realness” offered by using Google Maps is a double-edged sword,
especially for this game in particular. The Dreams of Ruin tend to flourish in
sites of great natural or human disaster. The second mission was in such a
place, and it already made me few slightly uneasy. By the end of 2016, I was
no longer willing to mine real-world tragedy for plot hooks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of the above factors contributed to sap any energy I had for keeping this
game going. Rather than leaving it entirely unsolved, I ended it officially and
posted all of the spoilers for the players to see. What the items in this
section taught me is to keep fights relatively simple in future games, and not
make them the central focus of the campaign. And to stick to fictional settings
for darker storylines. I’m OK with making <em>analogies</em> to real-world issues in
fictional settings, but outright using them as plots in a game doesn’t sit well
with me.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Doing “year in review” posts seems to be the thing to do, so I’ll write one as
well. This post started out as an overall overview of my 2016 tabletop gaming,
but that turned out to be mostly about GURPS anyway, so I’m categorizing it as a
GURPS post.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-blog">State of the Blog</h2>

<p>The big news here is that I started a blog! You’re looking at it! Octopus
Carnival is a little over three months old at this point: its first post went up
in September 27th, 2016. Let’s talk a bit about how it’s been doing.</p>

<p>I’ve been keeping track of how many visitors and views I get using Google
Analytics, purely for my own enjoyment as I’ve pledged to myself I wouldn’t
include adds or affiliate links here. The following comments about my traffic
all refer from the data registered in Analytics.</p>

<p>During the first month I managed to publish a post every day, making progress in
two still ongoing projects: an adaptation of Dragon’s Dogma to GURPS, and GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy versions of the Pathfinder Iconic characters. Whenever a new
post came up I posted announcements
to <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=146235">a thread in the Steve Jackson Games forum</a> and <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?791116-Blog-Octopus-Carnival-RPG-Posts">a thread on RPG.net</a>,
and after a while I started posting to a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114152615291904398040">GURPS community in Google Plus</a> and
to the [GURPS Discord  as well.</p>

<p>From October 26th to November 13th I was out of the country and didn’t have time
to post anything, which meant my carefully cultivated traffic fell to nearly
zero and I had to start over. My posting rate for gameable content isn’t quite
up to what it was before that trip, but that’s intentional: it was kinda eating
into the rest of my life. I still hope to post 2-3 times a week from now on.</p>

<p>Direct access seems to be the main source of traffic to the site, sitting at 21%
of the total. I imagine that’s not just people typing up the URL in their
browsers, tough that’s certainly part of it. Links that don’t contain a referrer
would also count towards this total, and a good bit of those are likely to be
people following internal links between posts.</p>

<p>The second largest source overall, and the main source of <em>referral</em> traffic is
the SJ Games forum threa, accounting for 20% or all sessions. Google Plus comes
in third overall. <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/">Gaming Ballistic’s GURPS Day posts</a> came in at fourth
until very recently, but were just edged out by an interesting phenomenom.</p>

<p>Looks like a couple of my posts were linked at a pair of Russian social
networks/blog sites, <a href="http://imaginaria.ru/">imaginaria.ru</a> and vk.com, and they got some attention from
Russian roleplayers. That’s something I never thought would happen, and it makes
me happy!</p>

<p>Most of those accesses seem to be to the Octopus Carnival home page, which means
a lot of people just go there to read the latest post. As for the individual
posts, the most popular ones are the Pathfinder characters, despite those only
technically being a side project. I can’t say I’m surprised that the Pathfinder
name draws eyeballs even on a blog with not a single d20 rule on it. It’s a big
name! <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">Amiri the Barbarian</a> is the most popular of the converted iconics,
being both the first I posted and the one that got linked to those Russian
blogs. <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros the Fighter</a> comes just below her, having also been linked
there. <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra the Cleric</a> is third.</p>

<p>Of the Dragon’s Dogma posts, the most popular are the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knight</a>
and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a>, which makes me happy because I’m proud of how they
turned out.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy about how I’m doing! Octopus Carnival isn’t as popular
as some of the superstars in the GURPS blogging community, but it does have a
following and that’s a lot more than I expected :). So thank you for reading it!</p>

<p>For next year, I’ll try to diversify my subjects a bit more. I’m literally one
article away from finishing the main Pathfinder series, and I can already see
the end of the Dragon’s Dogma posts as well. There’s <em>plenty</em> of other stuff I
want to say on all sorts of RPG-related topics, so I won’t run out of material
anytime soon.</p>

<h2 id="actual-play">Actual Play</h2>

<p>Pretty much all of my actual roleplaying in this past year has happened online
and asynchronously. I’ve been GMing a Dungeon Fantasy play-by-forum game over on
RPG.net for quite a while now, and while players have come and gone I managed to
get a small but solid core of players who don’t mind the occasional posting
slowdown and are entertained enough by my dungeons and the humorous interactions
between their PCs. In 2016 this game has continued, and we just managed to
complete our third dungeon delve (and our second full adventure!).</p>

<p>I had also started a GURPS X-COM game back in 2015, and until recently we had
managed to complete several adventures as well and make good progress on the
overall campaign (which was planned in far greater detail than the
dungeon-of-the-week DF game). Unfortunately, the game ran out of steam around
November, and I ended it with a post-mortem rather than letting it whimper out
of existence.</p>

<p>I also participated in a few forum games as a player, though all but three of
them died the usual death of forum games. Two are still ongoing: one is
Godbound, the other a homebrew science fiction system. One was a Legend of the
Five Rings 4th edition adventure that concluded successfully, and which I still
remember fondly.</p>

<p>Most of my face-to-face gaming has been of the board game variety. I’ve gotten
plenty of use out of the XCOM board game, and played a bunch of stuff from my
friends’ vast collections.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly <em>dissatisfied</em> with the overall situation in this area, but I do
wish I could play a few RPG sessions at a pace closer to real time. And that’s
what I’ll try to do in 2017.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Thief, which means today’s character is Merisiel. Here
she is:</p>

<p>Merisiel has all the knives. <em>All of them</em>. We’re back in familiar territory
with her, as she’s one of the Iconics from the core book. Her bio is <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la5z?Meet-the-Iconics-Merisiel">here</a>
and her stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/merisiel.html">here</a>. From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
hidden, to better backstab her foes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>.</p>

<p>First of all, she’s an elf, but <em>which type</em> of elf?  There’s like a hundred of
them in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy 3</strong>. Pathfinder’s stats for elves would suggest the
High Elf racial template is appropriate. That’s not all, however! Merisiel is a
<em>Forlorn</em> elf, which means she grew up among humans and had no contact with
elven culture to speak of. And the <strong>DF 3</strong> elf template that best models that
is the <em>Half</em>-Elf, even down to the problems relating to both humans and
elves. Theoretically full-blooded elves would have longer lifespans and such,
but that’s not worth any points in a <strong>DF</strong> campaign.</p>

<p>The other challenge is finding the appropriate template for her. The Thief
template from <strong>DF 1</strong> is a lot closer to the Thief class from early D&amp;D - a
middling combatant who’s great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult
places. The d20 Rogue class is still good at those non-combat things, but its
main focus is stabbing monsters for massive damage. This is why Merisiel’s
Pathfinder stats give her a rapier despite her bio’s focus on knives - it’s the
best melee weapon for rogues in that system. I’m going to use the Thief template
here, since it’s the whole point of this post, but I don’t want to leave the
stabbing part entirely out. Fortunately, the list of Thief Power-Ups in <strong>DF
11</strong> gives us something to remedy that.</p>

<p>Our version of Merisiel is quite sharper than her original bio indicates, though
I suppose it wouldn’t be apparent to someone who witnessed her failing two or
more simultaneous self-control rolls. Both her DX and IQ are one point lower
than you would expect for someone with these templates, to make room for the
stabby (Weapon Master for all sorts of knives and Backstabber). The reduced IQ
hurts some of her thief skills, but we make up for that with an extra level of
Manual Dexterity (which also affects DX-based rolls for Traps and Lockpicking).</p>

<p>Some future upgrades that look particularly appropriate are more levels of
Backstabber and Night Vision. As a member of one <strong>DF</strong>’s “skill monkey”
templates, she can also benefit from increases to all of her skills,
particularly Main-Gauche (which is a bit low for a weapon master) and the mental
skills hurt by the IQ reduction. Actually buying that “lost” point of IQ would
be a worthwhile investment, as would the Thief-specific Talents from <strong>DF 11</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the fourth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Saurians are the least populous of the three sapient species inhabiting the
Gransys peninsula. They are less technically sophisticated than humans but
require little in the way of tools due to their great strength and
hardiness. And while they’re not nearly as malicious as goblins, they’re
fiercely territorial and have no qualms about eating any trespassers.</p>

<p>A Saurian’s body is densely muscled and covered in scales similar to a
crocodile’s in texture. Their heads resemble those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona">bearded dragons</a>, and
their mouths are filled with sharp teeth. A Saurian is able to walk upright not
just because of its roughly humanoid limbs, but because of its thick tail that
acts as a counterweight and shifts its center of mass backwards. The final
result makes even a burly human warrior look rather puny.</p>

<p>Saurians live in small bands humans call “basks” for their tendency to be found
basking in the sun. They reproduce by laying large eggs with soft, slimy
shells that require constaint moisture, which means basks often claim territory
near large bodies of water.</p>

<p>Saurians fight using crude spears and polearms sized for their large
frames. These and the occasional rawhide satchel are the most sophisticated
tools any human has seen them use. Those experienced in fighting them know to
sever the tail: it can be targeted from the side or behind at a -2 penalty. Like
the tail of certain mundane lizards, it comes off easily: injury over HP/2 is
enough to sever it, which means the Saurian is unable to stand upright. This
doesn’t reduce its movement, but it <em>does</em> mean it can only use its natural
weapons to fight.</p>

<p>Saurians in this state will usually try to flee the battle. The tail grows back
in time even if severed!</p>

<p>Below are descriptions of all species of saurian found in the original game and
its expansion. They are meant to be worthy challenges to 250-point delvers,
which makes them quite scary for less powerful characters.</p>

<h2 id="common-saurian">Common Saurian</h2>

<p>The most commonly found variety of Saurian is a dark brownish green in color,
and conforms exactly to the general description above. They are cold-blooded,
and thus tend to keep to Gransys’ warmer southern reaches.</p>

<p>In the original game, there was a sizable group of them living in a flooded
seaside cave underneath Cassardis, complete with a large amount of eggs.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+4 imp or 2d+4 cut, Reach 1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+1 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); DR 4 (Tough Skin); Peripheral Vision;
Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain Adaptation (Swamp);
Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="sulfur-saurian">Sulfur Saurian</h2>

<p>This species of Saurian is so named for the color of their scales, which are
black with bright yellow streaks. They are a little more tolerant of the cold
than Common Saurians, and thus live further north. They share the same general
traits described above, and possess two other remarkable abilities: they can
shift the color of their scales to match their surroundings, and they can spit
paralytic venom!</p>

<p>Basks of Sulfur Saurians are common on the margins of the river crossing the
Cursewood in central Gransys and on the warm waters of Lake Hardship, being one
of the reasons for the lake’s name.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 17; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+5 imp or 2d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*. Often laced with the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d+1 cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF
3</strong>, p. 15) and from the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Poison Spit (12)</strong>: HT to resist; failure entails a non-cumulative -3 to DX
and IQ for 1 hour. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Chameleon 4; DR 4 (Tough Skin);
Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain
Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 1; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="geo-saurian">Geo Saurian</h2>

<p>This species has even stronger than a normal saurian, and has more clearly
supernatural traits. Their scales are black with small red streaks, and have a
metallic cast to them. Like sulfur saurians, they can change their coloration to
match the environment and have dangerous spit. Unlike sulfur saurians, their
sticky spit is <em>flaming</em>, not poisonous.</p>

<p>Geo Saurians can only be found on volcanic mountains or near active geothermal
vents. The most well-known concentration of these features is the Tainted
Mountain, which lies in the monster-infested range west of Gransys’s
borders. That’s not to say they couldn’t be found within some deep dungeon that
also had these features, along with other fire-themed beasts!</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 12U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 7 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 2d+3 imp or 3d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 2d-2 cut with linked 1d burning. The bite benefits from
<em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>, p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Flaming Spit (12)</strong>: 1d burning. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 2d cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Combat Reflexes; Chameleon 4; DR 7 (Tough
Skin); Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp);
Terrain Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="saurian-variants">Saurian Variants</h2>

<p>In all cases, the stat blocks above are for <em>average</em> saurians of each
type. The GM is free to increase their skills and attributes to produce
exceptional individuals without any additional justification! A few possible
variants found in the game merit special mention.</p>

<h3 id="giant-saurians">Giant Saurians</h3>

<p>Some saurians reach absurd sizes! Maybe they just never stop growing, or maybe
these have been contaminated by ambient magical energies. Take a normal saurian
and increase its SM to +2; multiply ST by 1.5. Their even bigger weapons add +1
to damage on top of the ST increase. Truly colossal specimens at SM+3, ST x2 and
+2 weapon damage might exist if the GM is feeling particularly sadistic.</p>

<h3 id="pyre-saurians">Pyre Saurians</h3>

<p>Despite their shape, they are not actual saurians, but lizard-shaped elemental
beings of pure fire and magma. Start with the stats for a geo saurian and change
its class to Elemental. Add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), +2d to the burning
damage from the bite and spit, and a 1d burning emanation in a 2 meter
radius. Fortunately, they use no weapons and always rely on their natural
claws, bite and tail.</p>

<h3 id="saurian-sages">Saurian Sages</h3>

<p>Despite their bestial nature, Saurians do have a mystical tradition centered
around mastering their vulnerability to cold. Those rare individuals who
complete a pilgrimage to the roots of the world are able to master cold itself!
To make a Saurian Sage, start with a normal saurian and remove
Cold-Blooded. Raise IQ to at least 12, and add three or more levels of Water
College Magery or Elemental Empowerment related to water. Give them any
appropriate ice-themed spells or elementalist powers you wish. If starting from
a geo saurian, their burning spit becomes freezing instead: it still does
burning damage, but it’s no longer incendiary.</p>

<h3 id="variant-stacking">Variant Stacking</h3>

<p>“Pyre Saurian” and “Saurian Sage” are incompatible with each other. You won’t
even find individuals of both types working together! However, both variants
<em>are</em> compatible with the “Giant” upgrade, and combining them can give you
something not entirely unlike a dragon.</p>

Jirelle. Here she is:</p>

<p>Even if you’re familiar with Pathfinder’s Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the “Advanced Class Guide” supplement. You can find her
bio <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg5a?Meet-the-Iconics-Jirelle">here</a>, and the only place where I could find her stats is inside <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">this
free package of premade iconic characters</a> that contains all of them.</p>

<p>From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
sunk her evil pirate’s mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
is returning them to the depths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
fencing skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out we have quite a bit more options when picking a template for
Jirelle than we did back when I first started writing this series! The recently
released <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers</strong> has <em>five</em>
different swashbuckler templates, each one with a slightly different focus! Now,
Jirelle’s piratical background might point to the Buccaneer, but her Pathfinder
stats are all about the flashy fencing with only a slight nod towards seafaring
skills. So it turns out that the default Swashbuckler template really is the
best choice here. We just have to make sure she knows how to sail.</p>

<p>I’m pretty satisfied with the result! <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> Jirelle has skill 20
with her rapier and skill 18 with her buckler, which enables some pretty cool
tricks. She also knows her way around a ship, and her Charisma helps boost her
social skills and Rapier Wit ability. Making her a better leader of men would be
a good use of earned character points, especially in parties that lack a more
dedicated social character. And of course, points spent on Rapier will never go
to waste!</p>

<p>Speaking of “points spent on Rapier”, this version of Jirelle spends one
character point on extra starting cash so she can afford the Edged Rapier.</p>
