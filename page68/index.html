<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>If you’re following this series mostly through Octopus Carnival, you might not
know I’m posting it on the RPG.net forums as well. The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2019/01/04/aboleth.html">Aboleth</a> entry
sparked some discussion over there, and someone told me there were a few more
aboleths detailed in Dungeon Magazine 170. Since I have that issue with me, I
took a small detour to talk about those aboleths before moving on to the next
Monster Manual entry.</p>

<p><em>City of Aboleths</em> was published in Dungeon 170, which came out in
September 2009. Despite the grandiose name, it’s not actually a adventure, just
a pair of combat encounters and a skill challenge. Written by Bruce R. Cordell,
it’s a tie-in for a Forgotten Realms novel, also by Cordell.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yes, there’s more aboleth lore here. There’s the classic bit about each aboleth
containing the racial memory of its whole lineage, which is always welcome. They
don’t die of old age and never stop growing, which is nifty.</p>

<p>Then there’s a bit about how they’re all p-zombies without a sense of self, and
another about there being a city called Xxiphu which is the oldest aboleth
settlement filled with all sorts of special “superior” aboleth and ruled by the
oldest aboleth ever. Both of these I’m willing to discard as being novel tie-in
dross.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The new monsters from this adventure are all those special “superior” aboleths
from the novel. All except the hatchlings have a <em>fly speed</em> of 8 in addition to
their land and swim speeds, and instead of the plain old Mucus Haze each gets a
specialized “haze” aura. The increased damage their tentacles do to dazed
targets has been separated into an ability called Mind Bore, which deals psychic
damage when the aboleth hits a dazed or dominated target with a tentacle. These
are the new monsters:</p>

<p>First we have the <strong>Aboleth Hatchling</strong>, a Small level 16 Minion Skirmisher. It
appears aboleths are born with Int 15 and an evil alignment, due to the weight
of all those memories. Their tentacle attack does increased damage to dazed
targets, as usual, and their haze is an Aura 1 that causes a <em>cumulative</em> -2
penalty to saves against daze or domination. Yes, if you’re surrounded by 4
hatchlings you get a -8 penalty to your saves.</p>

<p>The <strong>Aboleth Suffocator</strong> is a level 16 lurker with 124 HP. Its tentacles daze,
and it has a recharge 3-6 psychic blast called a Brain Lash that also does
ongoing 5 psychic damage. When damaged, it turns into a pillar of slime which
can’t attack, counts as insubstantial and can shift its full speed. The
suffocator can end this as a free action, so it’s useful for repositioning. Its
mucus aura gives enemies caught in it a -2 penalty to defenses and saving
throws. Fight a suffocator and a bunch of hatchlings and you’re going to dang
well <em>stay</em> dazed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Aboleth Perceptor</strong> is a level 17 soldier with 168 HP. Its mucus aura
allows it to ignore all concealment and partial cover when attacking anyone in
the aura. The tactics text says the aura also works for its <em>allies</em>, but the
stat block disagrees with that. The perceptor’s tentacles pull the target 3
squares and mark it, and it also has an Eye of Madness ranged psychic attack
(recharge 5-6) that dazes and marks. Anyone who flouts the mark gets punished by
a psychic blast that also makes them vulnerable to further psychic
damage. Lastly, the perceptor can shift 5 squares to chase marked targets, as a
move action (recharge 5-6).</p>

<p>The <strong>Aboleth Behemoth</strong> is a Huge level 19 Elite Controller with 362 HP. Its
mucus haze works as usual and gives enemies in it a further -2 penalty to saves
against daze and domination while the behemoth is bloodied. It makes 2 or 3
tentacles attack per turn, each of which grabs and dazes on a hit. Twice per
fight it can whip its tentacles around to hit everyone on a close burst 3 and
slide them 3 squares. Its Mind Bore deals ongoing 10 psychic damage instead of
just increasing the damage of a single attack by that amount. It also has
threatening reach, allowing it to make opportunity attacks against people up to
3 squares away. It fights much like its less special cousin, the Lasher, only it
takes up more space.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have the <strong>Aboleth Master</strong>, which doesn’t appear in the provided
encounters and is probably meant to be the “Eldest” aboleth everyone in the
novel is so intent on killing. It’s a level 22 Elite Controller with 418 HP. Its
haze makes enemies take a -2 penalty to Will against charm and psychic attacks,
and pretty much all of its attacks are psychic. It has the Overseer’s Dominate,
and Enslave, and can command dominated targets to use any power against their
friends, not just at-will ones like usual. Its Mind Bore does ongoing damage,
and it has a couple of neat tricks it can use as minor actions. Body Puppet is a
ranged attack that does psychic damage and slides the target 5 squares, but
ironically it targets Fortitude and so doesn’t benefit from the master’s own
aura. Mind Snap does target will, and also dazes.</p>

<p>Fun fact: <em>all</em> new aboleth here have a lower Int than the ones from the Monster
Manual. Even the epic Master has an Int of 22, smaller than the 23 of its
supposedly “inferior” brethren. The Behemoth has a 5.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These monsters bring increased variety to an all-aboleth dungeon, but there’s an
air of “these are from my novel so they’re extra-special” that bothers me a
little. Giving <em>all</em> aboleths a fly speed would be worth it just to see the look
on the player’s faces, though. The complementary haze auras thing could also
work well.</p>

<p>Still, there are a few weird things here, mostly the stuff that penalizes
saves. I’ve yet to see that anywhere else. There’s also the perceptor’s aura
doing one thing in the stat block and another in the description, and the
master’s aura not helping one of its own powers.</p>

<p>The two provided encounters are level 18, and take place in an “egg cyst”, a
cave lined with aboleth eggs and their hibernating guardians. The article
recommends adding it as a “side chamber” in a larger Underdark-themed
adventure.</p>

<p>The first encounter happens as the party enters the cyst and consists of the
classic combo of 2 Aboleth Lashers and 1 Aboleth Slime Mage, only this time they
have an entourage of 15 Aboleth Hatchlngs. The second one happens after they
cross a stream in the middle of the egg cyst, which wakes up 2 Suffocators, one
Behemoth and one Overseer from hibernation. If the PCs wade in the stream while
fighitng the first group, it <em>will</em> trigger the second, making them fight
against two encounters at once. I’ve had that happen with other monsters in my
own adventures, and it was always loads of fun… for me!</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Our first monster is the Aboleth, everyone’s favorite fishy
masterminds. Background information on them here is a bit sparse if compared to
previous editions, though this was remedied later in 4e’s lifetime. They’re only
on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The book says Aboleths are hulking amphibious creatures that originally hail
from the Far Realm, but now live in the Underdark, swimming its lightless depths
and creeping through its tunnels while leaving a slimy trail. Sometimes they
make their lairs closer to the surface, though. Aboleths are telepathic and may
live together as broods, attended by willing Kuo-Toa servants or by slimy
servitors created through a ritual from humanoid victims.</p>

<p>Peeking at the stats we can see all aboleths are Evil and highly intelligent
(Int 23), so they retain their story roles as fishy masterminds. The two new
things here, as far as I know, are making them amphibious and explicitly linking
them to the Far Realm. The amphibious thing is really welcome in actual play,
since it gives the GM lots more options for evil plans they can enact, and for
how the PCs can confront them.</p>

<p>The Far Realm thing is interesting because it provides us with a link between
aboleths and the other pseudo-Lovecraftian monsters in this edition. Basically,
anyone with the aberrant origin in 4e has some tie to the Far Realm.</p>

<p>Future books for 4e would elaborate on the Aboleths a bit more - they’re
actually survivors from a previous universe, escaping its destruction by hiding
in the Far Realm and then migrating to the current world after it was
created. I like that a lot! If you combine that with the “ancestral memory”
thing they had in previous editions, this means they have access to staggeringly
ancient and eldritch secrets. “Why yes, I just sold a copy
of Summon Azatoth to this dapper gentleman that came in here just before
you. Why am I packing my bags? No reason, really.”</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three aboleth stat blocks here. While they’re pretty different from each
other, they all share a few signature traits.</p>

<p>First, all of them have a swim speed of 10 and a land speed of 5. That means
they’re as fast on land as a dwarf or an armored man! They attacks work just as
well in and out of the water, of course.</p>

<p>Second, they all have an ability called Mucus Haze, an Aura 5 which makes
enemies treat the affected area as difficult terrain. Aboleths aren’t just
slimy, their slime is this almost sentient thing that pollutes the air and
clings to any who dare oppose them, slowing them down.</p>

<p>And third, their basic melee attacks (tentacles!) all cause increased damage
against Dazed targets. We’ll see how each aboleth variant exploits this.</p>

<p>Our first monster in this entry is the Aboleth Lasher, a level 17
Brute. Defensively it has 200hp and average AC for its level and role (29), but
his other defenses are lower than I would expect (27/25/25). Its tentacle attack
does Brute-level damage and Dazes, and it gets to make two against targets that
grant it combat advantage. A simple and direct creature with a simple and direct
strategy: charge someone and keep tentacling them until they die. Bonus points
if that someone is the wizard or another equivalent squishy. “Simple and direct”
doesn’t mean “dumb”, though. The Lasher has Int 23, so even he is qualified to
be a sinister mastermind and to fight smart. And as a Regular monster, he won’t
be alone.</p>

<p>The Aboleth Slime Mage is the Level 17 Artillery variant. It has better defenses
(AC 31, others 28/28/29), but only 128 HP to its name. This one is going to open
up with a Slime Burst that selectively targets enemies in an Area Burst 4, which
pretty much means “all the PCs”. It does okay damage and immobilizes with a Slow
after-effect. Then it’s going to use an at-will Dominate on the PC with the
lowest Will defense, and proceed to chuck Slime Orbs (that damage and Slow) at
the squishies (or anyone who managed to dodge the opening salvo). It can only
dominate one PC at once, but there’s a good chance <em>someone</em> will be dominated
at any one time. Anyone who attempts to engage the slime mage in melee has to
get through the Mucus Haze while slowed, so good luck with that. If they do
manage it, they will only have to contend with the mage’s lackluster tentacles,
and will be able to make opportunity attacks if it tries to use any of its other
powers.</p>

<p>Finally we have the Aboleth Overseer, a Level 18 Elite Controller (Leader). Its
defenses are the expected for its level, with Reflex being a little weaker. Its
Psychic Slime attack will likely catch the whole party in its area of effect and
Daze everyone it hits so the Lasher (above) can start doing increased damage
from the start. Fortunately, it can be used at most twice per fight. It has the
same Dominate attack as the Slime Mage, but it can follow that up with Enslave,
dealing obscene psychic damage to a dominated creature and making the domination
permanent if it reduces the victim to 0 HP. It can also make itself and one ally
temporarily invisible once per encounter, so it pairs well with a lurker. Its
tentacle attack does okay damage and Dazes as well.</p>

<p>Now, Enslave is a bit confusing. Does the victim get some HP back when its
enslaved, or do they just drop as normal? I’m inclined to go with the first
option, giving them a healing surge’s worth so they can keep being a nuisance in
the fight. In any case, the “permanent” domination ends if the rest of the party
manages to kill the Overseer. Should the Overseer manage to escape along with
the enslaved victim, it can use a special ritual convert them into an Aboleth
Servitor, which is actually for-reals permanent.</p>

<p>Aboleth Servitors are humanoids whose skin has been turned into transparent
slime. They have a swim speed and breathe underwater, but suffer greatly if they
get too far away from their aboleth master. The average servitor is a Level 16
Minion, but I imagine the GM could custom-build a “named” Regular or Elite
minion for those times when the aboleths manage to make off with an enslaved
PC. You can also make any other appropriate monster into a servitor by giving it
a swim speed and the Aboleth Devotion trait from the minion (and possibly
increasing its level to somewhere around 16 if it’s lower).</p>

<p>Suggested encounters are a level 17 composed of 1 Slime Mage and 2 Lashers
alongside a troop of Kuo-Toa minion guards, or a level 18 composed of 1 overseer
with 8 minion servitors plus a Nabassu Gargoyle and a Savage Minotaur, which I
guess would be those custom-built servitors I conjectured about.</p>

<p>These are “Final Battle” material for a level 13 or 14 party, or the sort of
patrol a level 17-19 party might expect when raiding the fortress of a large
aboleth brood.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I never gave aboleths much thought before, but these are quite nifty! I think it
helps a lot that they can go on land now. Your players might not find then as
nifty as I do, though, since they’re quite liberal with distributing the Dazed
condition. 4e players <em>hate</em> Dazed and Stunned, since they sharply limit their
actions during combat and can be actually harder to get rid of than being at 0hp
or less. Domination is a bit worse, because you’re both Dazed <em>and</em> playing for
the other team.</p>

<p>Aside from being highly intelligent, all the aboleths presented here are trained
in Arcana, Dungeoneering and Insight, so you can still have a scenario where the
party needs to negotiate for an aboleth’s services as a sage. Dungeoneering in
4e also includes knowledge about aberrant creatures, so it’s also a good proxy
for knowledge about the Far Realm.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Lately it seems “Let’s Read” threads of various D&amp;D books are becoming quite
popular over on RPG.net, so I though I would get in on the action, starting with
the first Monster Manual for Fourth Edition. And after thinking about it for a
while longer, I became convinced that you can’t discuss the first Monster Manual
anymore without also looking at the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition is one of my favorite editions of D&amp;D<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, even though it doesn’t
get much love from the general public these days. So I’m going to write these
posts assuming that the reader doesn’t have a lot of familiarity with that
edition. This means we’ll start with a basic explanation of Fourth Edition’s
philosophy on monsters.</p>

<p>One of 4e’s design goals, particularly in its early days, was a focus on
gameable content. That means that every monster in the Monster Manual has to be
something you can potentially fight. As a result, there are no harmless “fantasy
wildlife” entries here, and almost no “always Good” monsters. In fact, some
creatures that used to be “Always Good” in previous editions have been made more
morally flexible, to increase the chance that Good-aligned adventurers might
come into conflict with one. Harmless or always-Good creatures still exist, of
course, but the thinking here is that if it’s not something you’re going to
fight, it doesn’t need a full stat block. This is one of the things that got
edition warriors in a tizzy, but I kinda liked it.</p>

<p>The space saved from this is used to present you with several different stat
blocks for each entry. There is no “generic kobold”, for example, but rather a
mix of them built for different purposes so that you can design all-kobold
encounters with interesting tactical situations. They’ll still all feel like
kobolds, though, because all of them are going to have a few “signature” traits
that are common to all kobolds.</p>

<p>This brings up another major “philosophical” difference between this edition and
others, in that you’re pretty much never expected to fight any given monster by
itself. The CR system from Third and Fifth kinda leads you to think that
way<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but here it’s a little easier to keep in mind that an “encounter” is a
group of monsters with complementary abilities. Combat is a team sport!</p>

<p>Having said all that, I should point out a few bugs in the system that will be
particularly relevant for this Let’s Read. Fourth Edition’s monster design
system<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> was a little miscalibrated up until the release of the Monster
Manual 3. The main issue is that monster damage was too low, particularly for
high-level monsters. Elites and Solos also had defenses that were a bit too
high, which could extend combats past the point where they stopped being
fun. Since we’re reading the very first Monster Manual, every single monster is
going to have this problem, so I’m not going to mention it in each individual
entry.</p>

<p>That’s where the Monster Vault comes in. It was released a couple of years after
the first MM, as part of the D&amp;D Essentials line<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and it basically updated
all the most popular monsters from the early books to the new
math. Presentation-wise, it featured improved stat-blocks that were easier to
read at a glance along with larger and better-organized lore entries for each
monster. The idea here was that if you were starting out with the Essentials
books, you could get the Vault and skip the older monster books, and if you
already had those you could buy the Vault as an update.</p>

<p>I’m going to read both of them in parallel! Whenever a monster features in both
books, I’ll compare them and talk about the differences. Otherwise, I’m just
going to discuss the monster as presented, but will kinda assume you’re going to
apply the necessary fixes if you use any MM-only monster.</p>

<p>By the way, this is a list of quick fixes you can make to bring early monsters
more or less in line with the “new monster math”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add +1/2 level to all of their rolled damage (so a level 10 or 11 monster
would get +5 damage to all of its attacks).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add +2 to all attacks for Brutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduce all defenses for Elite and Solo monsters by 2.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first fix is courtesy of this <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=782">Blog of Holding post</a>, which also presents
another, unofficial fix proposed by players who still think the resulting
combats are too long: reduce base monster HP by 3 times the monster’s level. So
a level 10 regular would have 30 fewer HP, an elite 60 fewer, and a solo 120
fewer.</p>

<p>And that’s all for the introduction. Tune in next time for our first baddie, the
venerable Aboleth!</p>

            <p>Turn Undead was <em>the</em> iconic ability of old-school D&amp;D clerics, moreso than
spellcasting. They could do it at will right from level one. It started fairly
effective at turning skeletons and rapidly grew in effectiveness, affecting more
powerful types of undead and eventually destroying the less powerful ones
instead of just making them run away.</p>

<p>In Dungeon Fantasy, True Faith with Turning shares most of these traits. It
doesn’t let you destroy undead, but it still makes it a lot easier for the rest
of the party to finish the job. Particularly if they have ranged or high-Reach
melee weapons!</p>

<p>After several editions of evolutionary pressure, D&amp;D Turn Undead became quite
different. In most “modern” editions it was renamed to something like “Channel
Divinity” or “Channel Positive Energy”. It could only be used a few times a day
and had several possible effects. When used for its original purpose, it caused
damage to undead instead of turning them. The effectively turned it into a
secondary ability, taking a backseat to spellcasting.</p>

<p>This “new-school” form of Turn Undead might look something like this in Dungeon
Fantasy:</p>

<h2 id="channel-divinity-182736-points">Channel Divinity (18/27/36 points)</h2>

<p><em>Pre-requisite</em>: Power Investiture (Holy) or Holy Might 1+.</p>

<p>You channel the powers of your deity into a blast of glorious light that
emanates from your body and causes terrible burn to evil undead caught in its
radius!</p>

<p>Using this ability requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 2 FP. It affects
any foes who would also be vulnerable to standard Turning, out to a distance of
4 meters/yards from you. Roll a Quick Contest of Will with each such target. You
have a bonus to this contest equal to your Power Investiture (plus +1 or +2 for
an exceptional holy symbol) and a penalty equal to the distance between you and
the enemy in meters/yards. A monster’s Resistance to Good applies a bonus to its
Will. Any foe who loses this contest takes 2d, 3d or 4d of burning damage
(depending on the level of this ability). This damage bypasses all DR and
affects insubstantial undead!</p>

<p><em>Statistics</em>: This is Burning Attack 2d, 3d or 4d with the following modifiers:
Area Effect, 4m, +100%; Affects Insubstantial +20%; Malediction 1, +50%;
Affects only Truly Evil Undead, -50%; Costs Fatigue, 2FP, -10%; Emanation, -20%;
PM: Holy -10%.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>This power is basically just an area version of the Smite ability from <strong>Monster
Hunters</strong>. The Accessibility limitation that restricts the target it affects is
a <em>little</em> different, but I gave it the same value because it doesn’t change the
size of the affected group all that much.</p>

<p>It makes clerics a lot more dangerous against undead in close combat, and gives
Holy Warriors a good area attack option against such foes. Taking this instead
of traditional Turning sacrifices some tactical flexibility in exchange for
increased damage potential. It suits firebrand clerics of sun deities and the
like. Of course, there’s nothing preventing a suffciently powerful character
from eventually acquiring both!</p>

<p>Channel Divinity does <em>not</em> make [Smite Evil][1] redundant, since the valid
targets for both abilities are slightly different. Smite Evil could affect
demons, for example, but would do nothing against mindless undead. It can’t be
combined with Smite Evil.</p>

<p>Almost all of the classic Paladin abilities from D&amp;D have a clear analogue in
the list of powers available to Holy Warriors in either version of Dungeon
Fantasy.</p>

<p>With one exception.</p>

<h2 id="smite-evil-5-pointslevel">Smite Evil (5 points/level)</h2>

<p><em>Pre-Requisite</em>: Holy Might or Power Investiture (Holy) 1+.</p>

<p>You can empower your blows with the very wrath of the heavens! Channeling raw
Holy Might in this way can be tiring, but it can also be just the thing to bring
down a powerful servant of Evil.</p>

<p>You can buy as many levels in Smite Evil as you have levels in Holy Might. You
can declare you’re using it before you attack an enemy with your fists or with a
weapon. For each FP you pay (up to your level in this ability) your attack will
cause an extra 1d of follow-up burning damage to the enemy if it hits!</p>

<p>This damage is effective against insubstantial targets, even if your normal
weapon attacks aren’t. On the other hand, it only affects Truly Evil
foes. Smiting anyone else just wastes the FP, but at least you’ll know
immediately why it didn’t work. Detect Evil is a very useful companion to this
ability!</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> Each level is Burning Attack 1d (Follow-Up, Universal +50%;
Affects Insubstantial +20%; Variable +5%; Only against Truly Evil targets -50%,
Costs Fatigue, Variable, 1 FP/die, -15%, PM: Holy, -10%) {5}.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Smite Evil is the most popular ability of D&amp;D Paladins. It’s present in all
editions of the game, though its implementation differs substantially from one
to the other.</p>

<p>The ability as presented above is somewhere between the 3.5 and Fifth Edition
versions. Like the one in 3.5, it enhances a single attack and its use is a
waste if the target is not evil or if the attack misses. Like the one in 5th
edition, its use is limited by the same resource you would use to cast
spells. As a Holy Warrior, you have to put some thought on when you use Smite
Evil, but the cost of a missed attack can be recovered with a few minutes’ rest.</p>

<p>The “Only against Truly Evil targets” limitation is inspired by a similar
limitation in the Smite power found on <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1:
Champions</strong>. It includes a bunch of undead and demons, as well as a few other
monsters, but also <em>excludes</em> a lot of common opponents, so I feel that’s a fair
value. Damage from Smite Evil counts as holy, so if you have a Truly Evil
monster who is also extra-vulnerable to holy attacks, this will make them dead
very fast.</p>

<p>The variable fatigue cost limitation was calculated according to the guidelines
in <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 8: Limitations</strong>, and Universal Follow-Up is from its
sister volume on <strong>Enhancements</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want your holy warriors to smite evil at will, removing the variable FP
cost would bring the ability’s cost to something like 6 points/level and make it
a lot more devastating against evil monsters, particularly at higher
levels. Allowing it to affect <em>anyone</em> would make it cost around 8 points/level,
but would potentially step on the Knight’s toes. Doing both would bring the cost
up to around 9 points/level.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-smites">Alternate Smites</h3>

<p>Higher Purpose works as a lower-intensity at-will smite in the vein of
some D&amp;D 4 powers, since it gives bonuses to attack and damage against demons
and/or undead. Heroic Feats is a bit like Pathfinder’s version, giving you
bonuses for a limited amount of time instead of affecting one attack.</p>

<p>By the way, the Smite power from <strong>Monster Hunters</strong> would itself be a nice Holy
Might power for those characters who rely more on their strenght of will than on
their muscles. In Dungeon Fantasy it would cost 10 points/level and be similarly
limited by your level of Holy Might or Power investiture, and only affect Truly
Evil monsters.</p>

<p>All of these abilities can coexist peacefully in the same campaign, or even in
the same character with enough points. Smite Evil stacks with both Higher
Purpose and Heroic Feats, but <em>not</em> with Smite from Monster Hunters due to the
way Universal Follow-Up works.</p>
