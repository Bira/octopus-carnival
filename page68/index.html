<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>This is it. The final entry in the Monster Manual, the only Z monster, and the
penultimate post in this particular Let’s Read. Zombies have of course been in
the game since the very beginning. Here they are present both in the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>You know what they’re like: rotting corpses who slowly shamble around and attack
the living. They’re one of those monsters who made it into D&amp;D from popular
culture and are extremely popular outside of the game (like vampires, or
dragons). There’s a whole lot of different zombie versions out there, and it
seems the game has made an effort to incorporate most of them.</p>

<p>Like skeletons, zombies are often created through a necromantic ritual that
creates an animus and nails it to a dead body. They might also be spontaneously
created when an area is bathed in necrotic emanations, or when some sort of
divine curse falls over it, which is more common with zombies than with
skeletons.</p>

<p>The main difference, of course, is that zombies are still fleshy. That flesh
<em>remembers</em>, however poorly, what it’s like to be alive. A zombie’s dead heart
still pumps its rotten blood. Its lungs still wheeze, and its guts still
hunger. Left to their own devices, zombies will seek the warmth of the living
and try to eat their flesh, moving on to new victims when the current one gets
cold. Zombies who have a master will follow that master’s orders, but they’re
not smart enough to do anything complex.</p>

<p>Though the typical image of a zombie is that of an animated human corpse, that’s
not necessarily true! Anything that had a pulse in life can be animated as a
zombie, by ritual or accident.</p>

<p>D&amp;D zombies are not “contagious”, but you can still have a zombie apocalypse
when a sudden influx of necrotic energy into a region causes every corpse within
to rise as a zombie. And if the infusion is constant, then people killed by
these zombies would rise as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Zombies are Natural Animates with the Undead keyword. Their size is the same as
the original creature, usually Medium or Large. Monster Manual zombies have
necrotic resistance and radiant vulnerability like all other undead, but the
Vault ones aren’t so fancy and have neither. Most are fairly slow, with a Speed
of 4, but there are exceptions. They all have Darkvision.</p>

<p>The two signature traits for Monster Vault zombies are <strong>Zombie Weakness</strong> and
<strong>Deathless Hunger</strong>. The first one causes any critical hit to reduce the zombie
to 0 HP instantly (“Boom! Headshot!”). The other triggers when they’re reduced
to 0 HP: roll a d20, and if the result is 15 or more, the zombie remains at 1 HP
instead. This means they’re both unusually fragile and unusually tough. Several
MM zombies have similar traits, but they’re less universal.</p>

<h3 id="grasping-zombie-monster-vault">Grasping Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This Medium Level 1 Brute has 33 HP and all the standard traits. It attacks with
<strong>Slams</strong> that do extra damage against grabbed targets and can instead try to
grab someone with <strong>Zombie Grasp</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex) which does no damage but
grabs the creature (escape DC 12).</p>

<p>They naturally lend themselves to classic zombie horde tactics, surrounding
victims, grabbing and beating them up/biting them into chunks.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-monster-manual">Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This is basically a Level 2 version of the Grasping Zombie, with 40 HP. Its
defenses are actually a bit lower, but the escape DC for the grab is higher
because victims have a -5 penalty to escape it.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-rotter-monster-manual">Zombie Rotter (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A level 3 minion brute with a single <strong>slam</strong> attack, Speed 4, and none of the
special traits listed above. Pretty simple. Make sure to use literal hordes of
them.</p>

<p>The monster Vault instead has Zombie Shamblers, which are level 5 minions and
have Deathless Hunger, making them tougher than usual.</p>

<h3 id="gravehound-monster-manual">Gravehound (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A zombie dog! It’s Medium and unlike its humanoid counterparts it can run at
Speed 8. Its <strong>bite</strong> also deals ongoing necrotic damage (save ends), and knocks
Medium or smaller targets prone. It has Zombie Weakness, and when it hits 0 HP
it makes one last bite attack as a free action.</p>

<h3 id="corruption-corpse-monster-manual">Corruption Corpse (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A <em>regenerating</em> Medium zombie who uses this fact to rip out chunks of itself
and throw them at victims. It’s Level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. Its <strong>Grave
Stench</strong> acts as an aura (1) that inflicts a -5 penalty to all attacks,
discouraging enemies from getting into melee range. Its regeneration turns off
for a turn if the zombie takes radiant damage.</p>

<p>Though the corpse’s <strong>slams</strong> are weak, its thrown <strong>motes of corruption</strong>
(ranged 10 vs. reflex) do decent necrotic damage and weaken (save ends). When
killed, it explodes in a close burst 1 vs. Fortitude, dealing necrotic damage to
all in the area.</p>

<h3 id="hulking-zombie-monster-vault">Hulking Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This Large Level 4 Brute with 70 HP was clearly an ogre in life. Its <strong>slams</strong>
are Reach 2 and do extra damage to prone or grabbed targets. Its <strong>Zombie Rush</strong>
allows it to charge (with its speed of 4) and make an attack against Fortitude
that does the same damage as a slam and knocks prone.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-hulk-monster-manual">Zombie Hulk (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>Pretty much the same monster, only this one is Level 8 with 88 HP because MM
ogres are level 8. In place of Zombie Rush it has <strong>Zombie Smash</strong>, a recharge 6
melee attack that does a lot of damage and knocks prone. Zombie Hulk Smash, get
it?</p>

<p>Instead of Deathless Hunger it has the much more dangerous <strong>Rise Again</strong>, which
triggers automatically when the zombie hits 0 HP and makes it get back up with
44 HP at the start of its next turn.</p>

<h3 id="rotwing-zombie-monster-manual">Rotwing Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A <em>flying</em> zombie, either because it was a flying creature in life or because
some maniac stitched wings to it. It’s still speed 4 both in the ground and in
the air, so don’t expect fancy maneuvers here.</p>

<p>Still, it does have a little trick: its <strong>slams</strong> do extra damage when used as
part of a flying charge.</p>

<h3 id="flesh-crazed-zombie-monster-vault">Flesh-Crazed Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>AKA a “Romero Zombie”, which kinda steps in the ghoul’s toes. This one is a
Level 4 Skirmisher with 55 HP and all standard zombie traits. Its speed is 6, or
8 when charging. <strong>Flesh-Crazed Charge</strong> ensures its charges don’t provoke
opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>These zombies fight with <strong>clubs</strong>, which do extra damage on a charge. If they
can’t charge, they’ll <strong>bite</strong>, which actually does more damage and dazes for a
turn.</p>

<h3 id="chillborn-zombie-monster-manual">Chillborn Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The corpse of someone who died in the cold. It’s a Level 6 Soldier with 71 HP,
and exudes a <strong>Chillborn Aura</strong> (2) which does 5 cold damage per turn to those
caught inside. Multiple chillborn auras <em>stack</em>. This zombie also has Resist
Cold 10.</p>

<p>Hey, given enough of these they might end up damaging each other with their
auras! I don’t think this was the intention, so you can just say they’re immune
to each other’s auras.</p>

<p>Their <strong>slams</strong> immobilize for a turn and inflict ongoing cold damage (save
ends). When they die, <strong>Death Burst</strong> causes them to explode and deal cold
damage in a Close Burst 1 (vs. Fortitude). <strong>Ice Reaper</strong> makes either of these
attacks deal extra cold damage to immobilized targets.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I consider zombies to be an important part of the dungeon fantasy genre, which
includes D&amp;D. They’re not an exclusive monster or anything, but they’re
inevitably one of the first undead any party is going to face. The variety shown
here is interesting: though the MV stat blocks are a little better mechanically,
they’re also a lot more conventional in appearance and concept. “Normal zombie”,
“big zombie”, “fast zombie”. You should absolutely make an effort to spring the
more exotic varieties on your players if possible.</p>

<p>What about possible encounters? Any two-bit necromancer can animate a zombie or
ten, so they’re a good fit for any encounter or adventure that might include one
of those. Surprisingly they also work well with other non-sapient creatures, as
long as neither would eat the other and the living critters aren’t bothered by
the smell. The sample MM encounters bear this out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 3 standard zombies, 4 rotters, 4 kruthik hatchlings, and 2 wererats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 hulks, 2 rot scarab swarms, 1 oni night haunter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both encounters clearly include monsters who could be considered necromancers,
but I suppose the kruthiks and the scarabs could be found alongside zombies even
without a sapient to handle them. And of course, other undead work fine as
zombie buddies.</p>

<p>Yuan-ti have been in the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition. Here, they are both in the
Monster Manual and in the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yuan-ti lore has gotten more and more elaborate since their first appearance,
and by Fourth Edition it’s quite something. The Monster Vault has a doozy of an
origin story for them.</p>

<p>Back when the world was young, and the gods were still creating the mortals that
would inhabit it, the snake god Zehir found out he couldn’t make his own
mortals. So, being sort of treacherous asshole you’d expect a D&amp;D snake god to
be, he decided to steal some.</p>

<p>To that end, he seduced Avandra and tried to convince her to teach him how to
reshape mortals created by other gods. Being in love, Avandra accepted. Not
being a fool, she attached an extra condition to this power: Zehir could only
use it if the god that presided over the mortals in question gave him explicit
permission.</p>

<p>Of course, Zehir was a lot more of an asshole than Avandra suspected. When the
Dawn War was over, and the other gods were all weakened from all the fighting,
Zehir murdered the god of humanity. And now he had a whole mortal species to
mess with at will, no permission required.</p>

<p>Zehir took many humans and changed them into creatures whose shape pleased
him. These became the yuan-ti, his chosen people. They, in turn, built the
mighty empire of Zannad, which ruled over the whole world. From what I can piece
together from the other entries, the time of Zannad was after the fall of the
giants but before the rise of pretty much anyone else. Depending on how you
classify giants, you could even call Zannad the first mortal empire.</p>

<p>Eventually the surviving gods regained their strength and slapped Zehir around
until he relinquished his control over humanity. Though they argued for a while
over who would take custody of their souls after this, they never managed to
come to an agreement. And this is why the humans of today have the potential to
be both the most virtuous and the most corrupt of mortals: by default, their
souls belong to no god.</p>

<p>Slavery was the foundation upon which Zannad was built, and it fell when its
innumerable slaves successfully rebelled against their masters. The yuan-ti of
today are descended from those who survived Zannad’s fall, and in their minds
there is no greater aspiration than to rebuild their former empire in all its
cruel glory. The way the book describes it, they have a much better chance of
achieving this goal than the giants.</p>

<p>Throughout most of the world, the yuan-ti live in secret amid the other mortal
peoples and conspire to take over their power structures. They head secret cults
of Zehir and bestow minor reptilian transformations upon their human lackeys as
rewards for loyalty. These people are known as “snaketongue cultists”. Some get
inducted and transformed because they’re the sort of people who agrees perfectly
with Zehir’s philosophies. Others get kidnapped and transformed first, and then
convinced they must serve the god that “marked” them.</p>

<p>Yuan-ti conspiracies are many and varied, and in a lot of places people don’t
even know they exist at all. In other places, they already got to the point
where they can rule openly, such as in Zahnshahan, the Slithering City. These
serpentine city-states engage in trade and diplomacy much like any other mortal
realm, but their ultimate goal is always the subjugation of their neighbors.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most Yuan-ti are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
Resist Poison 10, and a natural speed of 7. All of their other abilities are the
product of training, so they vary a lot per stat block. These start at
mid-Paragon tier and go up from there, so by the time the PCs meet yuan-ti in
person they’ve likely worked their way through the bottom rungs of their
conspiracy pyramid.</p>

<p>Snaketongue cultists are Medium Natural Humanoids, more specifically
humans. Their minor mutations aren’t enough to give them the Reptile keyword or
any special powers beyond what they get from training. Like their masters they
rely both on their skill at arms and on any snake-and-poison-themed magic they
might have gained through arcane study or devotion to Zehir.</p>

<p>Cultists are more or less equivalent to the near-human “purebloods” of earlier
editions, and I guess that name was dropped because it was confusing (“why is
the least snaky variety named like that?”). 5e would adopt the name again and
make yuan-ti backstory even more elaborate in order to justify it.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault mentions the existence of snaketongue cultists but doesn’t
have stat blocks for any, though of course any human stat block can be used with
a few tweaks.</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-malison-sharp-eye-both">Yuan-ti Malison Sharp-Eye (Both)</h3>

<p>“Malison” is what the most common variety of yuan-ti is called. They’re
pretty much your standard Serpent People. Some have legs, some have snake
bodies, but all are equally mobile.</p>

<p>Sharp-eyes are Level 13 Artillery with 98 HP. They wield a <strong>scimitar</strong> in melee
and a <strong>longbow</strong> at range, and they ideally want to stay far away from the
opposition because their <strong>Chameleon Defense</strong> gives them partial concealment
from enemies more than 3 squares away.</p>

<p>The arrows from the longbow are envemomed - a hit with them triggers a secondary
attack vs. Fortitude, which does ongoing poison damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-malison-stalker-monster-vault">Yuan-ti Malison Stalker (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Stalkers are Level 13 Skirmishers with 126 HP. They wield <strong>morningstars</strong> with
interesting riders: a hit prohobits the target from marking anyone for a turn,
and does ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also throw <strong>poisoned daggers</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. AC) which do a bit less
physical damage but also have an ongoing poison damage rider (save ends). Their
at-will <strong>slither strike</strong> allows them to end any mark currently on them, shift
4 squares and make a dagger or morningstar attack at any point along the
movement.</p>

<p>Looks like stalkers are effective at shutting down a PC defender’s ability
to, well, defend. They can move past the party’s front-line and target the PCs
in the back, or flank said front-line to allow their own squishies to move away
unimpeded by marks.</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-abomination-both">Yuan-Ti Abomination (Both)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-yuan-ti-abomination.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a Large yuan-ti warrior that seems to always have a snake’s lower
body. It’s a Level 14 Soldier with 140 HP who fights with a <strong>bastard sword</strong>
and a shield.</p>

<p>The sword marks for a turn and does ongoing poison damage (save ends). The
abomination can use a minor action to grab a victim using its <strong>grasping coils</strong>
(melee 2 vs. Reflex), and it can <strong>bite</strong> a grabbed victim as its attack. This
does more damage than the sword, both immediate and ongoing.</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-malison-chanter-monster-vault">Yuan-Ti Malison Chanter (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This spellcaster is likely a priest of Zehir. It’s Level 15 Artillery with 118
HP. While bloodied, its <strong>Bloody Scales</strong> trait grants it a +2 bonus to speed
and to all defenses.</p>

<p>The chanter fights in melee with a <strong>bite</strong> that also causes ongoing poison
damage (save ends), and at range with a <strong>Mind Warp</strong> spell (ranged 20 vs. Will)
which does a bunch of psychic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks for a
turn. It can also use <strong>Poisoned Domination</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will) against a
target taking ongoing poison damage, dominating it for a turn. This is an
encounter power that recharges when the chanter is bloodied.</p>

<p>If hit by a melee or ranged attack, the chanter can use <strong>Deflect Attack</strong>
(recharge 4-6) to have it hit an adjacent ally instead. So make sure to surround
the chanter with lots of cultists!</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-malison-incanter-monster-manual">Yuan-Ti Malison Incanter (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>As the name hints, this is basically the same monster as the Chanter above, but
it’s stat block is different enough it warrants a separate entry.</p>

<p>The Incanter has the same level, HP, and bite as its Vault counterpart, but all
the other abilities are different. It has a <strong>Zehir’s Shield</strong> aura (10) that
gives all allies a +2 bonus to all defenses. <strong>Mind Warp</strong> dazes (save ends)
instead of inflicting an attack penalty. <strong>Poisoned Domination</strong> has a shorter
range (5) and has a daze (save ends) after-effect. Bloody Scales is replaced by
<strong>Slither Away</strong>, which is similar but grants a +5 to all defenses instead of a
+2.</p>

<p>There’s a new attack too, <strong>Zehir’s Venom</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude; recharge
4-6) which is almost exactly identical to Mind Warp but does poison damage
instead of psychic. <strong>Deflect Attack</strong> triggers a little less often (recharge
5-6).</p>

<p>So, in short, this is a much more complicated version of the monster, that’s
much more annoyong to fight.</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-malison-disciple-of-zehir-monster-manual">Yuan-ti Malison Disciple of Zehir (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>What a mouthful of a name, eh? This is a Level 17 Controller with 164 HP. It
projects <strong>Zehir’s Favor</strong> as an aura (10) which heals allies inside for 5 HP
per turn and does 5 poison damage per turn to enemies.</p>

<p>The disciple fights with a <strong>morningstar</strong> that has a secondary attack
vs. Fortitude to inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). This does stack with
the aura damage. It will also very often whisper <strong>Soothing Words</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Will; recharge 3-6), which dominate (save ends) and have a daze (save ends)
after-effect.</p>

<h3 id="yuan-ti-anathema-monster-manual">Yuan-ti Anathema (Monster Manual)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-yuan-ti-anathema.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Anathema used to be the sovereign rulers of the yuan-ti back in the bad old
days, but something happened to drive them mad and turn against their
subjects. Now they are kept imprisoned, and the other yuan-ti placate them with
sacrifices dropped from a safe distance. This is both out of reverence for Zehir
and out of fear that the anathemas will escape their prisons and eat the world.</p>

<p>These snakes-made-of-snakes are Huge Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile
keyword. They’re also Level 21 Elite Skirmishers with 412 HP. Their poison
resistance is 20, and their speed is 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>slam</strong> that also does ongoing poison damage (because
snakes). They can make two of these per action. They can also bite, which does a
bit more damage than a single slam and triggers a secondary attack
vs. Fortitude. This does more ongoing poison damage than the slam, and inflicts
a -4 penalty to attack rolls (save ends both).</p>

<p>The anathema can <strong>trample</strong>, moving its speed through enemy spaces (subject to
opportunity attacks) and making a special attack against vs. Reflex against each
one that does damage and knocks them prone. It can also make its <strong>horde of
snakes</strong> lash out at the same time (close burst 1 vs. Fortitude), doing physical
and ongoing poison damage to those it hits.</p>

<p>If it cares more about moving than about doing damage, the anathema can disperse
into a <strong>swarm of snakes</strong>, shifting its speed and reforming at the end of the
movement. This also recharges Horde of Snakes.</p>

<p>In short, after you’ve cleared the yuan-ti headquarters at the end of paragon
tier, you’re going to discover a whole other dungeon level filled with these
things and other monsters like them.</p>

<h3 id="snaketongue-cultist-minions-monster-manual">Snaketongue Cultist Minions (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>We have two cultist minions here: the Level 7 Initiate, and the Level 12 Zealot,
which seem to be skirmishers and are pretty much identical. They have speed 6
and fight with <strong>greatswords</strong> that do minion-scale damage and have the same
“secondary attack/ongoing poison damage” rider some of their bosses display.</p>

<h3 id="snaketonge-warrior-monster-manual">Snaketonge Warrior (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The non-minion version of the cultists discussed above. It’s a Level 8 Brute
with 106 HP, and its <strong>greatsword</strong> attack is a non-minion version of the one
described above.</p>

<h3 id="snaketongue-assassin-monster-manual">Snaketongue Assassin (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This Level 9 Lurker has 80 HP and uses a poisoned <strong>dagger</strong> to fight. It
suffers from the “naturalistic design” flaw, but has a “healthy” dose of ongoing
poison damage on a hit.</p>

<p>To protect itself, it uses <strong>Crowd Shield</strong> tactics, gaining a +2 to AC and
Reflex if it’s adjacent to one creature, or +4 if it has two or
more. Interestlingly, the assassin can also use a move action to assume
<strong>Serpent Form</strong>, transforming into a Crushgrip Constrictor and using all of its
stat blocks except for HP, which retains its current value.</p>

<h3 id="snaketongue-celebrant-monster-manual">Snaketongue Celebrant (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The bad guy your players fight just before discovering yuan-ti are behind it
all. This is a Level 11 Controller with 117 HP. It fights with a <strong>Scimitar</strong> in
melee that has the same secondary poison attack mechanic as the other weapons
here. At range it can use a <strong>Serpent Lash</strong> spell (ranged 5 vs. Will; recharge
4-6) to do psychic damage and force the target to grant combat advantage for a
turn. <strong>Coils of Despair</strong> (area burst 5 within 10 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6)
does no damage but restrains (save ends) and is likely to affect all the PCs at
once.</p>

<p>Like the Assassin, the Celebrant can also use <strong>Serpent Form</strong> to turn into a
crushgrip constrictor. In this case you might want to give a +2 to attacks,
damage and defenses to the snake form in order for it to match the human form’s
level.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The list of Monster Manual sample encounters tries to tell us why it did have to
be snakes. There are four encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: a whole bunch of snaketongue cultists and their pet flame snake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: An abomination, a sharp-eye, and more cultists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: A disciple of Zehir, an incanter, and 2 shadow snakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 dark nagas and an anathema. So now you know what the dark nagas
guard.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, that sure was a whole lot of snek. If that wasn’t enough for you, you can
also include medusas, since their entry says they some times work together with
yuan-ti.</p>

<p>I never really gave yuan-ti much thought, but the whole Zannad backstory here is
compelling, and it makes them have a lot in common with Lovecraft’s Serpent
Folk.</p>

<p>Wyverns have been in the game since its beginnings (or at least since
BECMI). Here, they are present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wyverns are the most famous “not-quite-dragons” of D&amp;D, and the ones most likely
to be confused with real dragons from a distance. The most obvious visual
difference is that wyverns lack front legs.</p>

<p>There are others, too, which become more evident when you interact more closely
with them. Unlike dragons, wyverns are non-sapient animals, and they also lack
magical breath weapons. Instead, they have a stinger at the tip of their tails
that can inject prey with a potent venom. They’re not as relentlessly voracious
as some of the other fantastic predators described in this book, but I imagine
they still might put a strain on any herds on their chosen territory.</p>

<p>In the wild, wyverns live in small groups called “flights”, which roost in high
places like mountains and hunt the surrounding region together. If you see a
flight of wyverns up close, it’s because they’re trying to eat you.</p>

<p>Wyverns can be tamed, but the process has to start shortly after they’re
born. As you might expect, there’s a market for eggs and hatchlings, and sapient
opponents might bring their pet wyverns to the fight.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for two species of wyverns here. Both are Large Beasts with the
Reptile keyword, and fight with their natural weapons: a bite, claws, and the
stinger. Wyverns are good fliers and much more agile in the air than on the
ground.</p>

<p>Note that wyvern damage as written is notoriously weak. Fixing this to use the
updated math should be a priority before you include them in an encounter.</p>

<h3 id="wyvern">Wyvern</h3>

<p>The more common variety is a Large Natural Beast with the Reptile and Mount
Keywords, and a Level 10 Skirmisher with 106 HP. Their land speed is 4, and
their flight speed is 8 with Hover.</p>

<p>Wyverns have two basic attacks: a <strong>bite</strong> with no special effects beyond
damage, and a slightly weaker attack with their <strong>claws</strong>, which can only be
done from the air and knocks prone on a hit. <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> allows them to fly
their speed and make one of these attacks at any point along the way without
drawing opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>They can also <strong>sting</strong>, of course, which does a little less damage than the
claw and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that deals ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the wyvern’s <strong>aerial agility</strong> gives its rider +2 to all
defenses.</p>

<p>I’m guessing the wyvern doesn’t bite very often. It’s going to use flyby attacks
to knock people prone, or sting if that’s not practical. Only a prone, poisoned
target will get the bite.</p>

<h3 id="fell-wyvern">Fell Wyvern</h3>

<p>A larger species which originated in the Shadowfell but is also present in
places where that plane intersects with the world. It’s a Large Shadow Beast and
a Level 24 Skirmisher with 228 HP. Despite not being undead, it has Resist 10
Necrotic and Vulnerable 5 Radiant. Its land speed is 6, and its fly speed is 12
with Hover.</p>

<p>Fell Wyverns fight mostly like wyverns with bigger numbers, and have all the
same attacks. Their venom causes “necrotic and poison” damage, so it’s harder to
resist. They can also use a <strong>pestilent breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6) that does immediate and ongoing necrotic damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a single sample encounter: level 10, an ettin marauder, a basilisk, and
2 wyverns.</p>

<p>I also imagine either wyvern is a pretty close fit to those fell beasts the
Ringwraiths rode in Lord of the Rings, though their actual level would depend on
how high-powered you view that story as.</p>

<p>Given that wyverns can be mounts, the most clichéd use for them would be to have
them as the “hostile humanoid” flying mount of choice, to have proper aerial
fights against human gryphon cavalry.</p>

<p>The first time I see the name “Worg” is in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Monster Manual,
where it was synonymous with “dire wolf”. The word itself comes from the Lord of
the Rings, I think. In Fourth Edition, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Worgs are not wolves, though they might be distantly related. Even dire wolves
are just animals, but worgs are sapient and evil. They also have some distinctly
un-wolf-like physical traits when you look at them from up close.</p>

<p>Worgs like the taste of sapient flesh and prefer it over any other prey. They
live in mazelike warrens, which they decorate with trophies of their
victims. Worgs on the hunt act as a group, but don’t cooperate very well, since
each individual is only interested in satisfying its own thirst for murder.</p>

<p>Worgs willingly ally with other sapient creatures that have a disposition as
nasty as their own, often carrying these allies into battle as mounts.</p>

<p>Oh, and the worg also has a larger and meaner relative: the elephant-sized
gulvoorg, which looks nothing like a wolf even from very far away.</p>

<p>I’m guessing you won’t find both worgs and normal wolves in the same wilderness
region - worgs are beefy enough to overpower even dire wolves in direct
fights. They’d enjoy it, too.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Both “strains” of worg are Natural Magical Beasts. They have trained Perception
and Darkvision.</p>

<h3 id="worg">Worg</h3>

<p>The basic model is Large and a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP. It has a speed of 8
and its <strong>Frightful Growls</strong> act as an aura (3) that gives enemies a -1 attack
penalty and allies a +1 attack bonus. Their only attack is a <strong>bite</strong> which also
does ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>I guess the main benefit of riding a worg into battle is that you’re always in
range of its aura.</p>

<h3 id="gulvoorg">Gulvoorg</h3>

</figure>

<p>These monsters are Huge, and Level 16 Elite Brutes with 384 HP. Their speed is
9, and they still have trained Perception and Darkvision.</p>

<p>Gulvoorg <strong>bites</strong> are Reach 2, and always knock prone on a hit. They can
perform Reach 2 <strong>tail slams</strong>, which are also considered basic attacks. On a
hit, they both knock prone and daze (save ends).</p>

<p>As a standard action they can use <strong>Gulvoorg Fury</strong> to make both a bite and a
slam attack, against different targets and with a -2 attack penalty. That
penalty is completely unnecessary, since we’re talking about an elite monster.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book gives us two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 3 worgs, 2 razorclaw stalker shifters, and 1 oni night haunter. An
oni and its evil henchthings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 gulvoorgs and 2 cyclops hewers. It’s even possible the cyclopes
are riding the gulvoorgs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Conceptually, I like worgs a lot more than I like dire wolves, and wouldn’t be
opposed to merging the two again. That way you get sapient evil worgs with the
interesting mechanical bits of dire wolves. Maybe add some wind powers so they
can huff, puff, and blow your house down.</p>

<p>Wolves are real animals and have been part of the game since its
beginnings. Here, they are both in the Monster Manual and in the Monster Vault’s
animal appendix.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Real-world wolves are pack hunters, and the ancestors of modern dogs. If I
recall correctly they mostly stay away from people and only attack when cornered
or really desperate. There are enough stories about wolves attacking sheep and
other farm animals that it must have happened in the past, but it’s not really a
common occurrence any more. And that’s partly because there are very few wolves
left in the real world.</p>

<p>D&amp;D wolves are of course a lot more common and a lot more willing to attack
people, since a pack of wolves is a classic low-level wilderness encounter. They
can be found across a wide variety of climates and terrains. Mountains? Check!
Forests? Check! Plains? Check! Deserts? Why not?</p>

<p>This being D&amp;D, there might be some natural landscapes where your reasonably
realistic grey wolf might have trouble competing with the more fantastical and
powerful monsters common to the game. Instead, these places might feature dire
wolves, which are a larger, smarter and more dangerous variety. As of 3e,
they’re also spikier.</p>

<p>In addition to being found in the wild, both common and dire wolves might be
trained by humanoids such as goblins or shifters, who have a knack for taming
wolves directly without having to spend centuries turning them into dogs. Other
creatures might also control large packs of them through magic: vampires are
famous for this.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Wolves are obviously Natural Beasts, even the dire variety. They have low-light
vision, and their other acute senses are represented by Trained Perception. They
run at speed 8, attack with <strong>bites</strong> and usually do something interesting when
they have combat advantage.</p>

<h3 id="gray-wolf-both">Gray Wolf (Both)</h3>

<p>Gray wolves are Medium, and Level 2 Skirmishers with 38 HP. As far as natural
wolves go, it seems to me these would be on the large end of the scale, which
might explain why they’re more eager to attack humans than you’d expect a
mundane wolf to be.</p>

<p>Their sole attack is the <strong>bite</strong>, which does extra damage against prone
targets. The bite in the MV version also allows the wolf to shift 4 squares <em>as
an effect</em>, so these critters will never stay still if they can help it.</p>

<p>If a wolf has <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> against a target, its bite will also knock
the target prone on a hit. This means a group of wolves has a lot of incentive
to flank a specific PC. One of them knocks the victim prone with its first bite,
the others pile on with that bonus bite damage. All of them keep moving around
with those free shifts. And now you know why they call this “wolf-pack tactics”!</p>

<h3 id="dire-wolf-both">Dire Wolf (Both)</h3>

<p>Dire wolves are Large, which means each is roughly horse-sized. They’re Level 5
Skirmishers with the Mount keyword and 67 HP.</p>

<p>Dire wolf <strong>bites</strong> have larger numbers due to them being higher level, and also
do increased damage to prone targets. They also knock the target prone if the
wolf has <strong>combat advantage</strong> against the target, and the monsters have more
ways to get that other than plain old flanking.</p>

<p>The text for “combat advantage” in the MM version says the dire wolf has CA
against any target who has at least one other ally adjacent to it. No flanking
required. This could be interpreted to mean that a dire wolf with a rider always
has CA against any enemy adjacent to it! The MV version of this trait, named
<strong>Pack Harrier</strong>, says it only works when the wolf has two or more allies
adjacent to the enemy. So the rider still counts, but you need a second ally to
get the bonus.</p>

<p>They also have a trait called <strong>Pack Hunter</strong>, which grants their <em>rider</em> combat
advantage if an ally other than the mount is adjacent to the target. So if you
go with the MV text, the rider would get CA whenever the wolf got it, and
vice-versa.</p>

<p>I’m guessing that the MV version is the “correct” one in all aspects
here. A wolf that got permanent combat advantage against everyone would be a
little overpowered due to that knockdown effect on the bite.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two sample encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 3 gray wolves, 2 hobgoblin archers, and 1 hobgoblin warcaster. Your
standard hunting party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 3 dire wolves, and 2 longtooth shifter hunters. A mounted hunting
party.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Werewolves are also quite likely to be leading dire wolf packs, and Count Strahd
in the original Ravenloft module quite famously commanded a literal army of dire
wolves he could send after the PCs every night until they entered his castle.</p>

<p>Dire wolf-riding goblins are also a classic image, though the levels are a
little mismatched as printed. It would be easy enough to level the goblins up or
the dire wolves down, and it’s quite plausible for the Small goblins to be
riding Medium gray wolves instead of the Large dire ones.</p>

<p>These days “you’re attacked by a pack of wolves while on the road” strikes me as
a little uninspired, though I think they’re OK when used as muscle by sapient
opposition.</p>
