<p>Welcome to another installment of “Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels!” You can find links
to the whole series in its <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a>. This time we’ll go through Part 3
of its first adventure. It’s titled “Redactions and Revelations”.</p>

<p>As always, we’ll be taking a look at how our hypotethical party consisting
of <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> would fare here as GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy delvers.</p>

<p>As I probably mentioned in a previous post, Rexus’ parents were members of the
Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society of Irori<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> worshippers dedicated
to discovering and preserving the true history of Kintargo and Cheliax. The
Chelish government dislikes them intensely, since they’re all about redacting
that truth and replacing it with their own propaganda<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. That’s why they
burned the Victocora estate down with most of the family inside.</p>

<p>Rexus, however, believes his parents might still be alive and hiding in the
Order’s secret headquarters. His conviction that this must be the case grows as
he works on the Silver Ravens document cache the PCs retrieve in part 1. Some
time after that work is complete, he approaches the Ravens and proposes they
look for his parents.</p>

<p>He reveals the hideout’s location, under an abandoned museum of curiosities
named Hocum’s Fantasmagorium. He’s never been there, but one of the things in
the box his parents left for him was a mytrhil key that opens the secret door to
the compound. At the very least, the place should contain some of his mother’s
personal effects. Laria also encourages the PCs to go there, since if the
Archivists survive they’d be the perfect allies.</p>

<p>Unlike the more freewheeling part 2, this one consists of a single large dungeon
delve, but we still have some flexibility in deciding when it starts. Rexus will
only approach the PCs for this after he finishes the translation, but you can
decide exactly when that happens. Starting it while multiple other missions from
Part 2 are still ongoing is perfect to give your players a sense of “so many
things to do, so little time”, but if you think they’re already feeling
overwhelmed it might be better to wait until the other stuff is done. The book
recommends waiting since it thinks the PCs should be level 3 to have a chance
here… but if you’re running this using GURPS Dungeon Fantasy, there’s no need
for that.</p>

<h2 id="hocums-phantasmagorium">Hocum’s Phantasmagorium</h2>

<p>One thing the PCs will quickly discover when they begin casing this joint is
that the Asmodeans got here first. The Barzilai himself visited this place years
ago disguised as a traveling scholar, on his quest to learn about the dark
ritual that would make him immortal. Once he took power in Kintargo, he turned
over the hideout’s location to the Church of Asmodeus, and they sent a team of
ninja librarians to take it out and Redact All The Things. Some of them are
still here, hard at work, and Thrune sometimes sends his henchwoman Nox to keep
an eye on them.</p>

<p>Some judicious information gathering by the PCs prior entering the site can
reveal the presence of the Asmodeans, otherwise they’re in for a surprise. The
museum’s doors are all sturdy with good locks, but the mytrhil key opens all of
them.</p>

<p>Searching the <strong>Box Office (E2)</strong> will net the PCs some loose change and a <em>ring
of swimming</em><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. The <strong>Hall of the Cryptids (E3)</strong> is full of fake or
mislabeled skeletons, some of which have been animated by the Asmodeans to act
as guardians. The <strong>Hall of the Seas (E4)</strong> has a couple of spontaneously
generated undead mermaid-things who rise from their aquarium at night.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hall of Insects (E5)</strong> is now home to a clutch of giant spiders who were
accidentally broken out of stasis by a greedy Asmodean who mistook the souvenir
badge amid the eggs as a big treasure, which makes the stuff on his corpse the
<em>actual</em> treasure at this location.</p>

<p>That’s it for the west wing of the building. The east wing has a wax gallery in
room <strong>E7</strong> that might give the PCs a scare if they think he statues will
animate (they won’t, but one of their eyes is a gem). Room <strong>E8</strong> has a bunch of
charred zombie guards who will attack anyone not wearing Asmodean colors. These
are the corpses of the people who were inside the Victocora estate, including
Rexus’ parents, who still wear their wedding rings. Bringing the rings back to
Rexus will give him some closure and a bonus XP reward.</p>

<p>Rooms <strong>E9</strong> and <strong>E10</strong> are the gift shop and the administrative office. They
currently house a team of ninja librarians (AKA Asmodean Redactors with levels
in Monk) and their evil cleric boss, hard at work reviewing museum documents for
inconvenient truths. They’ll probably move to investigate any commotion in the
museum level. The redactors should be built on 125 points with Martial Artist
skills and abilities, and the cleric is a full 250-point Evil Cleric with a
spell selection that allows invisibility and paralysis.</p>

<p>Room <strong>E6</strong>, right in the middle and back of the building, is a small exibit on
the dead god Aroden. His statue hides the secret passage to the hideout
below. PCs can figure out the combination to open it if they pay attention. They
can also brute-force the lock through skill checks or actual brute force.</p>

<h2 id="the-many-steps-monastery">The Many-Steps Monastery</h2>

<p>This is the hideout proper. It’s occupied by the bulk of the redactor task force
and their assorted bodyguards and defenses, including Nox, the regenerating
henchwoman they met in passing during Part 1. It’s deep enough underground that
the enemies here can’t hear fights happening topside. The name is a joke about
the amount of stairs in the place, made by its former Iroran occupants. Unlike
the museum, the layout of this lower level is mostly linear.</p>

<p>The stairs from area E6 above lead into <strong>The Sacred Archive (F1)</strong>, a cavernous
library that used to be filled with historical records and rare tomes (made
rarer by Chelish redacting). The place is now almost bare, with the few
remaining tomes waiting to be examined by the redactors. It’s guarded by a type
of outsider called a Scrivenite, which is basically a living book that can take
a humanoid form made out of fluttering pages and long bookmark ribbons. This one
has been bound to aid the redactors, is quite resentful of the fact, and will
gladly answer questions about the other defenses and enemies down here as long
as the PCs don’t try to advance further into the complex. They will eventually
have to, which will cause the spirit to warn the other redactors
telepathically. If the PCs can somehow prevent it from doing so, they will have
the element of surprise.</p>

<p>Areas <strong>F2</strong> and <strong>F3</strong> were the living quarters for the Archivists, now taken
over by the redactors. If the PCs manage to get here without raising an alarm,
there’s a chance they can catch Nox sleeping.</p>

<p>Area <strong>F4</strong> is the <strong>Artifact Recovery</strong> room. The Archivists were also in the
business of locking dangerous cursed artifacts away, it seems. Most of the stuff
here has been carted off to Barzilai’s opera house base, but something called a
<em>cubic gate</em> was left behind. I suspect this is one of those Hellraiser puzzle
boxes, given the mess it made when the redactors activated it by
mistake. Four of them are in here trying to figure the thing out. They’ll
hide in the room and watch the PCs fiddle with it for a while before
attacking. See? Ninja librarians.</p>

<p>Area <strong>F5</strong> is a mostly uninteresting lecture hall, currently used as a kennel
for Nox’s pet hell hound. If the PCs get this far without raising an alarm, the
creature will be here.</p>

<p>Next is the <strong>Common Room (F6)</strong>, which is where most of the redacting work
currently happens. There’s five Redactors in here plus a half-ogre
bodyguard. Pathfinder half-ogres are horribly deformed and mentally handicapped
wretches, in keeping with the game’s theme of “ogres as inbred cannibal
hillbillies”. This one’s mind has been further muddled by years of Asmodean
mental control. It should be built with the Brute and Half-Ogre templates, with
particularly low IQ. Smart PCs can easily divide-and-conquer this lot, since the
half-ogre won’t attack unless the PCs attack it directly or try to move past it
to the next area.</p>

<p>The final area is the <strong>Meditation Garden (F7)</strong>, a large chamber with an
underground river running through it and some impressive landscaping. This is
where Nox and her pet hellhound can usually be found, so you might as well call
this place the “Boss Fight” room.</p>

<p>Nox is <em>technically</em> human, but she’s sold her soul to a devil in exchange for
power. She’s a level 5 fighter specializing in polearms, who can also
regenerate, teleport and summon a lemure. In GURPS, she should be built with the
Knight template and wield a dueling glaive, and should have Unholy powers
matching her supernatural abilities from D&amp;D. Overcoming her regeneration should
require Holy attacks, and the book also suggests that drowning her in the
underground river would kill her for good. If Nox dies, she definitely won’t be
coming back - her contract ensures her soul goes straight to hell.</p>

<p>Would a cleric’s spells automatically count as Holy Attacks? That’s an
interesting question. The original Pathfinder weakness is “good spells or good
weapons”, so maybe you have to use a Holy Might power from a Good
deity. The general guideline is that she should have the same vulnerabilities as
a real demon in your campaign.</p>

<p>After the PCs deal with Nox, they can loot the room of the books she’s been
reading to pass the time. These were created by the scrivenite we described
above, and contain a rendering of the memories and knowledge of several of the
deceased Archivists… including Rexus’ parents. Through these, it’s possible to
procure their aid, after a fashion.</p>

<h2 id="adventure-conclusion-and-commentary">Adventure Conclusion And Commentary</h2>

<p>The Fantasmagorium looks like a pretty standard dungeon delve if you play it as
written: enter room, kill enemies, loot, rinse, repeat. While it’s true that the
people in one level can’t hear what goes on in the other, there’s no reason why
all those ninja librarians and their assorted hencthings wouldn’t investigate
fights happening on the <em>same</em> level. So you <em>can</em> run this dungeon as a brutal
raid where most enemies in the level converge on your party as soon as the alarm
is raised. This would be murder on a level 3 Pathfinder party, of course, but
might be just the thing to make it really challenging to a party of Dungeon
Fantasy delvers. Conversely, if the party takes pains to be stealthy and remain
undetected, this could be a tense infiltration mission where success is rewarded
with plenty of opportunity to shank surprised villains.</p>

<p>Clearing out the museum and hideout officially concludes the adventure. If you
haven’t played through all the events of Part 2, the book advises doing so
before moving on, and generally giving the PCs some room to breathe. By the end
of Adventure 1 they should be well on track to becoming the most powerful
opposition to Barzilai’s government.</p>

            <p>I would say it’s time for another State of the Octopus post, but the truth is
I’m late! Let’s get to it already, then.</p>

<p>May saw a whopping 644 sessions from 448 unique visitors to Octopus Carnival,
numbers which are almost twice those of April. This time the US had the clear
lead in the number of sessions, with 304. Brazil came in second with 162. The
others had a slightly higher number of sessions as well, but remained arrayed in
more or less the same positions.</p>

<p>Facebook was still the largest source of referrals at 130 or so, but Google
Plus was close behind it with 128. Looks like announcing posts in a general
roleplaying group there paid off.</p>

<p>Looking at the most accessed pages for the month, we had two individual articles
beat the home page in number of accesses for the first time ever: <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/21/to-gurps-or-not-to-gurps.html">To GURPS or
Not To GURPS</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/24/alternatives-to-gurps.html">Alternatives to GURPS</a>, a pair of opinion pieces on
when I think it’s appropriate to use GURPS for a game and what I use when the
answer to the first question is “no”. I was very surprised by their popularity,
both in number of views (139 and 133) and in how much discussion they ended up
generating (tough mostly in Google Plus instead of in the article
comments). Note that both of them came out towards the end of the month, too.</p>

<p>I’m very satisfied with the blog’s performance in May, and quite surprised
anyone cares about my opinion :). I hope I can keep the good work going forward.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/209884/Planet-Mercenary-RPG">Planet Mercenary RPG</a> is a space opera game set in the same universe as
the excellent webcomic <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/">Schlock Mercenary</a>. In it, the players take the role
of officers in a 32th-century mercenary company. They take on varied contracts
from all manner of client, human or alien, lawful or shady. Said contracts often
result in a copious amount of explosions with a healthy side order of humor.</p>

<p>This game started out as a Kickstarter project organized by the comic’s author,
Howard Tayler. Being a fan of the comic, I backed it, and it recently reached a
successful conclusion. The PDF can now be bought on the link above for US$25.00,
and overall I consider it well worth the money if you’re looking for a
relatively light and very chaotic action-oriented system. Familiarity with the
comic only makes the whole thing better, but is in no way required for your
group to have a good time with this game.</p>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>The main text of the book is presented in a double-column layout, in a font I
found easy to read. The page background is white, with light purple margins on
the “outer” side of each page. The page numbers and associated decoration are
done in a “techy” style meant to give the impression you’re reading the text on
some futuristic electronic device. As I have the PDF version, that turned out to
be the actual case!</p>

<p>There’s a fair number of well-done illustrations here, most of which depict
whatever is being currently discussed in the text itself, be it a typical member
of a species, a specific individual, a place or a piece of equipment (from
pistols to warships). The images use a more realistic and detailed style than
the Schlock Mercenary comic, and some of the landscapes done in this style can
be quite spectacular (just look at the cover above).</p>

<p>The text of the book also contains one of the best examples of game fiction I
ever saw. Instead of a short story or comic at the start of the book, this one
is told through a series of editorial notes on its margins. “Planet Mercenary”
is the name of an in-setting corporation that specializes in selling weapons to
mercenary companies, and the RPG itself is written like a piece of promotional
material for them. The editorial notes in question are from the <em>fictional</em>
staff responsible for writing the book, the idea being that they were supposed
to be removed but were left in by mistake. They serve to both add color to some
of the passages in the main text and to tell a story about the characters making
the comments. I was going to say it’s a surprisingly good story for in-game
fiction, but it’s not actually surprising at all given it was written by Howard
Tayler, the comic’s author (who also, IIRC, wrote all the setting information
here).</p>

<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>

<p>Anyone familiar with the comic should know the setting of Planet Mercenary
pretty well already. Even if you’re not, you shouldn’t have much trouble
understanding the setting with the information included in the book.</p>

<p>Planet Mercenary takes place in our Milky Way galaxy, in the year 3100. Galactic
society is incredibly diverse, encompassing a very large number of alien species
and AIs with intellects ranging from “quite dumb” to “godlike”. All of these
people get into fights with each other often enough that there’s no shortage of
mercenary companies willing to get paid to do fight for them.</p>

<p>Humans have been a part of this hodge-podge for about 900 years, but there are
many species far older than ours out there. Heck, there’s more than a few
<em>individuals</em> older than our species.</p>

<p>The book includes detailed information on several important systems and worlds,
most of which were featured in the comic at some point. There’s also a few
places that are new to this book, and provide new and interesting ways to kill
your PCs even if they’ve read all of the comic already. The descriptions are
humorous, but also succeed in being good space opera on their own merits.</p>

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

<p>Such a wide-open setting can theoretically allow for <em>any</em> sort of game, but
Planet Mercenary helps you out by narrowing the focus to something that should
feel quite familiar to fans of the comic. As mentioned in the introduction, PCs
in Planet Mercenary are officers in one of the setting’s many mercenary
companies. Character creation should be a group effort, since the last step
involves creating the company the characters work for!</p>

<p>The system is almost entirely skill-based. There are no attributes like
“Strength” or “Dexterity”, and stuff that would modify those in other systems
(such as your species) modifies skills instead. There are two derived stats,
Health (which is basically HP) and Defense (how hard you are to hit). Players
begin by picking a Command Package that describes their function in the company,
a Background Package that describes what they did before enlisting, and a
Sophont Type, or species. While the setting has thousands of sophont types, the
book provides details on twelve particularly interesting or common ones, four of
which are actually from Earth (humans are prolific uplifters).</p>

<p>All of these provide you with a set of skill modifiers and one or more
species-specific special abilities. With those in front of you, you then
distribute 40 skill points to round out your character.</p>

<p>With characters in hand, players then create their company by spending Resource
Points, with are the game’s abstraction for large sums of money. They use this
to buy a warship and its controlling AI, and convert the remainder into Supply
Points (i.e, smaller chunks of money) used to outfit the PCs with their
gear. Gear stats are usually quite simple, but they get the job done.</p>

<p>As officers, PCs never go into the field alone. Each is in command of a fire
team of three NPC Grunts, which has simplified stats and acts on the PC’s
orders. They may also be accompanied by a larger, more abstract group of grunts
not under their direct control.</p>

<p>In addition to acting as an extension of your character, Grunts can also act as,
well, Ablative Meat. That’s the actual name of the rule. This basically means a
grunt can take an attack that would normally hit a PC. The more times they
survive the experience, the more detailed their descriptions get!  Losing a
seasoned grunt can feel like losing a friend… but if they stick around long
enough they can get promoted to full PC status when their comanding officer
finally buys the farm.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>If the mechanics of Planet Mercenary can be said to have an overall theme, that
theme is <em>chaos</em>. The galaxy is a big, chaotic place and the PCs are expected to
get into messy, unpredictable and often violent situations. Even with the
best-laid plans, anything can happen once the excrement hits the ventilator.</p>

<p>The basic mechanics are simple. Players roll 3d6, add a relevant skill, and try
to get a result higher than a GM-set difficulty, which goes from 7 for
super-easy tasks to 30 for nearly impossible ones. The GM is expected to mostly
eyeball these difficulties - there are no detailed tables of modifiers to be
found here. Combat uses basically the same system, with the target number
usually being the enemy’s Defense. Combat <em>initiative</em> doesn’t use dice at all -
whoever speaks first, goes first. Yes, this makes fights quite lively, and yes,
there’s a fairly large advice section on how to deal with potential problems.</p>

<p>The other thing that really gives Planet Mercenary its unique flavor is the
Mayhem mechanic. One of those three dice should be distinct from the other two
somehow, and is called the Mayhem Die. When a test is successful and the Mayhem
Die has a higher number than the other two, the person who just rolled draws a
card from the Mayhem Deck included in the game and (usually) immediately
resolves the effect described there. There are about a hundred cards, sorted
into descriptive suits such as “Kill”, “Die”, “Bleed”, “Block” and so on.</p>

<p>Mayhem effects can happen on <em>any</em> test, not just in combat! The effects are
pretty varied and described a bit vaguely: the players and GM are expected to
work them into something tht makes sense for the current ongoing scene. Some are
beneficial, some quite detrimental, and most are somewhat ambiguous but
guaranteed to make things more interesting in the Chinese curse sense.</p>

<p>There’s also a “Roleplaying Points (RiPP)” mechanic, which combines with Mayhem
to make things more varied. Players can use RiPPs to re-roll some of all of
their dice in a test, to negate a Mayhem effect, or to invoke the Ablative Meat
Shield rule (see above). The GM, conversely, is expected to hand out RiPPs to
players for good roleplaying and to negate Mayhem cards that would hurt the game
rather than make it more fun.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Planet Mercenary was something of a rarity for me, in that it’s a system I feel
like playing after reading through it. It has enough unique mechanics that it
would be hard to replicate the same “feel” in another system, and it’s very
well-suited to its setting (which I love).</p>

<p>In fact, the Planet Mercenary rule set even has utility <em>outside</em> its home
setting. I can’t think of any other system I would rather use to play in the
Warhammer 40.000 universe. It does <em>Only War</em> better than <em>Only War</em> itself, and
I feel writing psyker rules for Planet Mercenary would be less painful to me
than enduring a whole campaign with that percentile system.</p>

<p>The intrepid soldiers of my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">X-COM campaign</a> have just completed their second
field op and returned alive but not unharmed. They discovered and explored a
huge Forest of Woe in southeastern Brazil, met a new and more dangerous type of
enemy, and brought back what seems to be an alien defector.</p>

<p>At this point I once again invited the players to step out of character for a
while, and we entered the game’s second strategic/research phase. The bonus
event they got this time was a debriefing of the alien refugee, because Sokolov
was their head scientist. Had it been one of the others, this would have been a
normal research choice and would cost points.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-event-the-refugee">Bonus Event: The Refugee</h2>

<p>The alien is around 1.5m tall, and quite skinny. Its body is covered in a dark
purple, chitinous carapace, over which it wears clothes. It has four arms and
two legs, and moves in a somewhat discomforting and “twitchy” fashion. Its seems
to wear a mask, as there is a clear seam between its face and the rest of its
head, but this “mask” is soft and warm and almost human-like, and moves like it
was a natural face. It’s a strong royal blue in color. The alien’s eyes are
yellow with black pupils, and it has a very pronounced nose. This being does not
have a gender as humans conceive of the concept.</p>

<p>As a genderless alien who wants to come and meet us, it was inevitable that the
refugee would receive the code-name of Ziggy (from David Bowie’s Ziggy
Stardust). Despite Dr. Vahlen’s strenuous protests, Dr. Sokolov elected to
debrief X-COM’s new guest by personally interviewing Ziggy, since it was capable
of communicating in English.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s use of grammar was quite peculiar, and it refused to use the pronoun
“I”. Sokolov soon found out the movements of its mouth didn’t match what it
seemed to be saying, and recordings of the interview only showed it speaking the
same alien language the PCs had heard over their comms multiple times. As a
result, the interviews were all transcribed the old-fashioned way, using the
services of a stenographer.</p>

<p>Ziggy gave X-COM some basic organizational information on their opposition: they
were made up of multiple alien species, some from previously conquered worlds
and some engineered for war. The leaders of this force called themselves the
Ebon Masters, and arrived on Earth through “gates”. The trees were part of a
weaponized, artificial ecosystem it called “The Moon Flower”. Ziggy had been
only a civilian clerk in the employ of the Masters, so he wasn’t able to provide
much in the way of specific strategic detail.</p>

<p>Ziggy also referred to something called “The One Power” several times, and said
none of the species previously conquered by the Masters had such an advanced
mastery of it. Figuring that misunderstanding out quickly revealed that the
advanced alien technology on display so far was, in fact, magic, and that humans
were totally ignorant of it. Ziggy became as fascinated by this revelation as
Sokolov was about the existence of magic.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the alien Masters, Ziggy’s look and culture are a mashup of the
original Ethereals from X-COM and the devils from the
excellent <a href="http://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a> comic. It’s the equivalent of a Blue
Devil, so low-ranked but quite intelligent. Ziggy also has a <em>conscience</em>, which
makes it nearly unique among its species.</p>

<p>The whole “friendly alien helps X-COM” idea sprung from a My Little Pony fanfic,
of all places. That story is <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/100455/stardust">here</a> if you’re curious, and though it becomes
a bit muddled later on its premise was interesting enough that I decided to
recycle it with a more campaign-appropriate alien.</p>

<h2 id="research-options">Research Options</h2>

<p>This time, the players had 2 research points to allocate. Their options were the
following, with the ones in italics being new:</p>

<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Research</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Medkit (this was Vahlen’s “free” project”) 0/1</li>
  <li>Personal-scale combat drones (this was Shen’s “free” project) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Project Stardust</em> (Employ Ziggy as part of the research staff and harness the
One Power) 0/2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alien Artifacts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pinnochio (Puppet of Ruin) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Rosie (Bakegumo) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien guns 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien swords 0/1
 -Alien Explosives (from grenades/RPG rounds) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Black Trees</em> (Study those substantial Black Tree pieces) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Red Dust</em> (It’s sprinkled over every alien body and artifact, as you’ve
discovered earlier) 0/1</li>
</ul>

<p>The group discussed this for a while. Two new players had joined the group at
this time, and they provided their input as well. In the end, Project Stardust
won out. It was the equivalent of researching psionics in the computer games,
and it was even more vital here than in the original material.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-setting-information">The One Power: Setting Information</h2>

<p>What Ziggy called “The One Power” is the ability to cause direct changes to
physical reality by visualizing them in extreme detail and willing them into
existence. It’s called that by the Ebon Masters because they never before had
encountered a civilization that managed to achieve more than a medieval level of
technology without resorting to it.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s description of the theoretical underpinnings of the One Power match a
lot of human occult lore, sharing several similarities with Kabbalah and
Pythagorean numerology among other sources. Manifesting a given effect requires
modeling it through an equation in the alien numerological system, and then
repeatedly solving it in one’s mind. Using it in practice requires more than an
active imagination and skill at mathematics, however!</p>

<p>Medical scans show Ziggy’s body is permeated by an extensive network of
circuit-like metallic filaments, made from the same materials detected in the
tree fragments. These are naturally occurring in every species capable of using
the One Power, according to the alien. These “circuits” act as a conduit for it,
and take on some of the work of processing those mental equations.</p>

<p>Once X-COM’s scientists and engineers figured out the basics of how all of that
works, they realized it wasn’t much different from modeling a physical process
in software. With this knowledge in hand, they were able to separate the steps
of building the necessary model (“compilation”) and running its simulation
enough times to manifest the effect (“execution”). Sokolov didn’t like calling
these things “spells”, so he named them “metatronic loops” to make the whole
thing sound more scientific.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-game-mechanics">The One Power: Game Mechanics</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, the One Power as used by the aliens is basically Ritual Path
Magic from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions</strong> and <strong>GURPS Thaumathology:
Ritual Path Magic</strong>. The main break from those supplements is that the aliens
are able to use it to create permanent items and constructs, which is where all
the “TL 4+n” stuff comes from.</p>

<p>The bit about naturally occurring “magic circuits” is swiped from the <em>Fate</em>
franchise; their game effect here is to allow a character to buy Magery (Ritual
Path) and Ritual Adept. Humans in this game lack these circuits and so can’t use
“classic” RPM at all. However, this discovery allows them to build similar
circuits into <em>computers</em>, giving them access to the Technomagic variant from
<strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology</strong>.</p>

<p>The immediate game effect of this discovery was to add a new item to the group’s
master equipment list: the Metatronic Device, a hardened, custom-made PDA that
could store one metatronic loop in its memory and run it at the tap of an
icon. The thing’s processor would burn out after the effect ended, but it would
be possible to carry several of them into the field. The first loop available
was one that completely protected everyone in a given radius from the Hostage
Effect (AKA psychic numbness) for up to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Players can also elect to learn ritual magic paths from now on - once they do,
they’ll be able to develop their own loops using the top-of-the-line setup at
X-COM HQ and take them into the field using the PDAs. For now they’re limited to
what the NPC scientists can make.</p>

<p>Another, less visible effect of the discovery was to give X-COM access to the
magical side of every other discovery they made through research! This is why
researching the One Power was so vital - every possible countermeasure for the
Dreams of Ruin involves a healthy dose of magic, particularly the higher-end
ones. They couldn’t arrive at any of those solutions without this knowledge.</p>

<p>Once the choice was made and the effects explained, I took a little time to come
up with their next mission. In the next update to this series, we’ll begin
covering Operation SNAKE OIL.</p>

</figure>

<p>Welcome to another installment of “Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels!” You can find links
to the whole series in its <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a>. This time we’ll go through Part 2
of its first adventure. It’s titled “Rebuilding the Ravens”.</p>

<p>As always, we’ll be taking a look at how our hypotethical party consisting
of <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> would fare here as GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy delvers.</p>

<p>“Adventure Path” style modules have a reputation for being extremely
railroady. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/10/hells-rebels-adventure-1.html">Part 1</a> certainly lives up to that, since it consists of a series
of tightly scripted scenes and two back-to-back dungeons where the PCs have no
real alternative other than delve right in.</p>

<p>In Part 2, however, we leave the rails behind for a bit! It starts by stating
that the PCs plus Rexus and Laria are the group best-positioned to offer
organized opposition to Barzilai Thrune in the whole of Kintargo. It goes to
show how thorough the guy was in killing everyone else, I guess, since right now
our heroes have a snowball’s chance in Hell of taking him down. Before they can
have a shot at The Barzilai, they need to expand the newborn Silver Ravens into
a proper rebel army and consolidate support for their position.</p>

<p>The PCs are expected to engage with the custom rebellion rules at this point,
which means this part of the adventure will play out over multiple weeks of game
time and will largely consist of PC-initiated actions and their consequences as
they focus on recruiting agents and gaining supporters. The book lists several
special events and missions that will happen or become available while the PCs
do this. By the end of the first adventure, the Silver Ravens should become a
substantial movement with broad support among the oppressed of Kintargo, and
should be ready to move out of Laria’s basement and into a more permanent base.</p>

<h2 id="a-spy-among-us">A Spy Among Us</h2>

<p>The events mostly concern Blosodriette, the imp the party has unwittingly
brought from the Fair Fortune Livery along with the documents they recovered
there. She will hang around the hideout either invisible or transformed into a
rat or spider. Her goal is to be set free without being banished back to Hell,
and she begins sabotaging the rebels in an attempt to either convince the PCs to
let her go or to attract attention from outside allies who can free her.</p>

<p>The GM is free to come up with clues and setbacks caused by the imp. Events in
the book go from structural sabotage to mind-controlling an otherwise innocent
NPC into betraying the group to the dottari. The PCs can thwart her in several
ways: finding the contract and ripping it up will send the imp back to Hell, as
will spotting the invisible devil and defeating her in combat. If a PC happens
to belong to the Sarini noble lineage, they can actually <em>command</em> Blosodriette
and turn her to their service, since the contract binds her to that lineage.</p>

<p>It’s probably best if these events are interspersed with the special missions
the book describes later, and/or with the normal turns of the rebellion
management mini-game. Solving each one gives the party a XP award, as does
defeating the imp. Of course, the party might end up finding the imp quite soon,
and all of this will be moot if they already dealt with her back at the
Livery. Defeating the devil early awards the party XP for any events that hadn’t
occurred yet; the party <em>was</em> successful in preventing them, after all.</p>

<p>There’s another unrelated event here that provides a bit of foreshadowing about
the Rose of Kintargo, an NPC who appears in the second adventure. Foreshadowing
is all this is, but I suppose it’s possible for a frustrated party to link
this to the imp’s sabotage instead. It’s something to watch out for.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>Blosodriette should be built as a Wizard with the Shapeshifting, Suggestion and
False Memory spells, plus any pre-requisites and other spells the GM deems
suitably annoying (like summoning swarms of rats). In her natural form, she’s SM
-3. Her advantages include Flight (Winged) and switchable Invisibility as an
advantage rather than as a spell, since she can keep it up for a very long
time. Her disadvantages include Sadism and an Obsession with being freed from
her contract, as well as any vulnerabilities common to demons and devils in your
game.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

<p>These are “special missions” which occur outside the rebellion management
rules. They’re numbered, but can happen in any order as decided by the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="mission-1-decode-the-documents">Mission 1: Decode the Documents</h3>

<p>Decoding the documents requires skills with Linguistics and fluency in
Celestial, Elven and Strix. Rexus has all of this and will take 7 weeks to do
the job by himself, but PCs who also meet the prerequisites can try to help
shorten this time. Finishing the job in 4 weeks or less is worth bonus XP, and
regardless of the time it takes the party will get a permanent bonus to all
Silver Raven organization stats from the tactical information contained in
there. They’ll also learn a lot about the history of the original group.</p>

<p>Since this is a long-running thing, the PCs can obviously engage in other
activities or missions while it goes on.</p>

<h3 id="mission-2-investigate-the-fires">Mission 2: Investigate the Fires</h3>

<p>A lot of places connected to dissident characters and organizations burned down
in the Night of Ashes, and the PCs can look into those fires if they are so
inclined. The only site that will yield something of value are the ruins of the
Silver Star, Shensen’s shop, which has a hidden stash of potions and scrolls
which wasn’t damaged by the fire. More substantial clues as to what happened at
these locations will be found elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="mission-3-prisoners-of-salt">Mission 3: Prisoners of Salt</h3>

<p>Freeing the high-profile prisoners from Kintargo Castle might be more than what
the group can handle at this point, but that’s not the only place where
prisoners are being held. A group of rogues and mercenaries friendly to Laria is
being held prisoner at the Salix Salt Works, and they would make a good addition
to the Silver Ravens. They’re guarded by a group of thugs hired by Thrune.</p>

<p>The book provides a keyed map of the area, but this will be mostly just a big
brawl. There’s a total of eight CCG Thugs led by a dwarf fighter named Kessrin,
but only half of the group is on guard duty at any one time, with the other half
asleep in an outbuilding. Our hypothetical party should have no trouble at all
moping the floor with these doofuses, particularly if they strike at
night. Rescuing the prisoners allows the PCs to recruit them to the Ravens.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-1">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>We already discussed the CCG Thugs in Part 1. Kessrin should be built as a
well-armored dwarf Squire with a few extra points of ST, Overconfidence, and the
Throwing skill. He wields a mace and shield, and has a couple of alchemical
grenades. The original uses Tanglefoot Bags, but the GM might want to employ
something more devious like poisons or sleep potions.</p>

<h3 id="mission-4-murders-in-the-nursery">Mission 4: Murders In the Nursery</h3>

<p>Remember how I talked about Golarion having more horror elements than your
typical D&amp;D setting? We’ll get to see some of them here.</p>

<p>You see, tieflings face a lot of racial prejudice in Cheliax, even in
Kintargo. I find this a bit surprising in a nation that generally considers
everything devil-related to be just swell. Perhaps the justification for this is
in a setting book I don’t have. Most of Kintargo’s tieflings live in a decrepit
slum nicknamed “The Devil’s Nursery”, and the harassment they face when they try
to move out makes it very difficult for them to do so.</p>

<p>Thrune made their lives even worse by not only imprisoning the most effective
advocate for their civil rights during the Night of Ashes, but having a witch in
his employ conduct an horrific ritual in the Nursery that summoned a pack of
eight tooth fairies (the <em>Hellboy</em> kind, not the children’s story kind). The fey
roam around the slums every few days, killing people and taking their
teeth. It’s causing a panic that may erupt into a riot if nothing is done about
it. If the PCs help here, they’ll earn many supporters from among Kintargo’s
downtrodden.</p>

<p>This mission is a meaty investigative scenario - all the PCs know at the start
is that people are getting killed in the slums. This might require interviewing
reluctant witnesses, examining a body before the locals can cremate it, or even
having one of the PCs act as bait for the killers by wandering the streets alone
at night.</p>

<p>The fairies fight to the death once they’re cornered in their lair, which is
also where the PCs can find the remains of the ritual that summoned the fairies
here, which include the body of a child. Treating it with respect and solving
the case earns them extra supporters in the coming weeks.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-2">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>A GM who wants to really focus on the investigation here might break out the
rules from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters</strong>, which cover the “identify the monster and
find it” part pretty well. Social skills would be useful for interviewing
witnesses, <strong>Diagnosis</strong> for examining the bodies, and <strong>Hidden Lore (Faeries)</strong>
to idenfity the culprits and their weaknesses.</p>

<p>Pathfinder Tooth Fairies are pixy-sized fey (SM -6) who wield magical pliers
that attack like SM 0 magical knives and give them the ability to pull out
someone’s teeth mid-fight. They also have a paralytic bite, and explode into
nauseating glitter when they die. The eight fairies in this encounter can give a
party who relies exclusively on physical attacks some unexpected trouble!</p>

<p>As for our party, this would mostly be Lem’s and Meririel’s show until they
managed to confront the fairies, in my estimation. Fighting them might be tricky
unless Lem can get off a Mass Daze or Mass Sleep spell, or Kyra can set them on
fire.</p>

<h3 id="mission-5-crackdown-at-clenchjaws">Mission 5: Crackdown at Clenchjaw’s</h3>

<p>Clenchjaw’s was a fairly unremarkable bar until recently. Now it’s becoming a
hotbed of anti-government sentment as well as the stage for huge, nightly
brawls. Its owner used to keep a lid on this stuff, but he’s been passing out
early each night for some weird reason. PCs can get involved here while looking
for recruits.</p>

<p>PCs who look hang around the bar long enough will eventually find out the cause
of the increased chaos is Vendalfek, a fairy dragon! He moved here after the
other bar he lived in was burned in the Night of Ashes, and has been using his
illusion powers to make Clenchjaw’s rowdier to stave off his boredom. This in
turn attracted more dissidents to the place.</p>

<p>Vendalfek can be convinced to stop his shenanigans peacefully, and some skilled
diplomacy might convince him to join the rebellion as a special ally. Outright
invinting him to live on their base will have the same result. Failing to
resolve the situation will eventually cause the bar to be raided, which will
cost the Ravens some supporters.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-3">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Vendalfek should be based on the Shoulder Dragon template on p. 27 of <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 5: Allies</strong>, with the addition of some spellcasting ability
focused on illusion. He makes a good spy, being basically a less powerful but
also less ethically questionable version of Blosodriette the imp.</p>

<h3 id="mission-6-an-unsanctioned-excruciation">Mission 6: An Unsanctioned Excruciation</h3>

<p>This section goes on a bit about “excruciations”, which are public torture and
humilation sessions the Chelish government likes to punish its dissidents and
criminals with. Barzilai’s preferred method is “doghousing”, in which the victim
is forced to share a space with two large angry dogs for days and choose between
fighting them for food or starving. No official excruciations are scheduled
during this adventure, but the ever punchable members of the Chelish Citizen’s
Group have decided to perform a few of their own.</p>

<p>This is an event that should happen once the Silver Ravens have gained a fair
bit of notoriety. The CCG captures a friendly NPC who isn’t a member of the
Ravens, perhaps someone who helped the PCs during Mission 4 or 5, and stages a
doghousing in Aria Park. The PCs should get wind of this fairly quickly once it
happens, since it’s not exactly a discreet event. It’s up to them whether and
when to stage a rescue, but waiting too long will obviously prove lethal for the
victim.</p>

<p>Fighting the four CCG thugs and their two big angry dogs would be a literal walk
in the part for our brave delvers. Doing so in a public fashion increases the
Ravens’ notoriety, but I personally think it’s worth it. The dottari show up a
few minutes after a fight breaks out, but by them the party will be long gone.</p>

<h3 id="mission-7-threat-of-the-red-jills">Mission 7: Threat of the Red Jills</h3>

<p>The Red Jills are a small but violent gang of thieves who are taking advantage
of the current chaos to prey on the citizens of Kintargo. They leave the dottari
and the CCG alone, so Thrune lets them keep operating to keep the population
afraid. As such, making them stop will benefit the Ravens.</p>

<p>Recruiting the Jills as allies isn’t possible: they’re led by Scarplume, a strix
with a particularly fierce hatred of humans. Tracking the Jills down to their
abandoned orphanage hideout will lead to a big fight.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-4">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Once again the investigation rules from <strong>Action</strong> or <strong>Monster Hunters</strong> would
do a good job here! <strong>Streetwise</strong> and <strong>Area Knowledge (Kintargo)</strong> would be
particularly important for finding the hideout.</p>

<p>Strix are winged humanoids, and their stats should be basically like a human’s
aside from the Flight (Winged) advantage. Scarplume is a sorcerer whose spell
list can be summed up as “All The Fire”, which means she can be statted up as
either a Fire Elementalist or a DF Sorcerer with lots of burning Innate
Attacks. She has Intolerance (Humans) and a host of other sociopathic
disadvantages. The rest of the Jills should be built using the Cutpurse or
Skirmisher templates from <strong>DF 15</strong>, and should all be non-human.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it for part 2 of the book! Part 3 contains a substantial dungeon delve,
but doesn’t necessarily happen after all of the events here: the timing for that
is entirely up to the PCs, so they might end up having to deal with the stuff
here even into the second adventure.</p>
