<p>Hawks are real world animals, and though they are birds of prey they’re fairly
small and don’t usually attack people. For these reasons, 4e doesn’t consider
them “monster material”, and this entry focuses on supernatural hawks that can
pose a bigger threat to adventurers.</p>

<h2 id="blood-hawks">Blood Hawks</h2>

<p>As Small Natural Beasts, Blood Hawks are bloody enormous for hawks. They’re also
a lot more aggressive than usual, and their claws deal wounds that bleed
profusely. This, and their reddish coloration, gives them their name.</p>

<p>A blood hawk is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 27 HP. It has a flight speed of 6, and
a ground speed of only 2 (and it’s Clumsy while walking). Its basic attack is a
<strong>Claw Rake</strong> that deals standard physical damage and inflicts 2 ongoing damage
(save ends). This ongoing damage raises to 5 if the hawk is bloodied.</p>

<p>The blood hawk can also make <strong>Flyby Attacks</strong> at will. This follows the
standard rules seen in other monsters: it flies its speed, makes a basic attack
at any point, and doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving away from the
target.</p>

<h2 id="frost-hawk">Frost Hawk</h2>

<p>A Small Elemental Beast native to certain ice-aspected regions of the Elemental
Chaos, the Frost Hawk can also be found in mountaintops and other cold places of
the world. It’s a Level 7 Skirmisher with 80 HP, making it a lot more formidable
than any mundane hawk. Its flight speed is 8, and its ground speed a
clumsy 2. It has Resist Cold 10.</p>

<p>The hawk’s <strong>Ice Talons</strong> serve as its basic attack, dealing a mix of physical
and cold damage. It has the same Flyby Attack as the blood hawk, and it adds a
couple elemental powers to its arsenal. <strong>Freezing Screech</strong> is a Close Blast 3
vs. Fortitude that deals cold damage and slows (save ends). <strong>Shattering
Strike</strong> is a passive trait that make all its attacks deal extra damage against
slowed targets.</p>

<p>So a frost hawk is going to start a fight with the Screech, and will then focus
its flyby attacks on one of the targets it managed to slow. It pairs really well
with controllers and other monsters with the ability to slow enemies.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>In addition to being found in the wild, hawks might also be found in the service
of many sapients. Falconry is a real-world sport with roots in the Middle Ages,
so of course it’s extensively practiced in the medieval-ish setting of 4e. The
sample encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 2: 3 blood hawks, 2 bloodseeker drakes, 2 elf archers. A hunting party
going after dangerous game?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 frost hawks, 1 orc bloodrager, 1 orc eye of gruumsh. Orcs also know
falconry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think these supernatural hawks would make for an exciting encounter by
themselves, but the falconry angle has promise. Lots of enemies become 20%
cooler if you give them a badass hawk friend.</p>

<p>Half-Orcs have been in the game since the days of AD&amp;D, where they appeared as a
playable option in the Player’s Handbook. Historically, they were one of the
first “edgy” options for players, but they’ve always been a bit controversial
and surrounded by Unfortunate Implications. The main one being that most
versions of them implied that there was only one very unpleasant way in which an
orc and a human could have a child.</p>

<p>In more recent years, several different solutions to this have been
proposed. Some remove half-orcs from the game, others say they’re full orcs and
that’s what a full orc looks like. Fourth Edition went with a third common
option, which is to diversify the origins of half-orcs.</p>

<p>They appear as a playable option in the PHB 2, and have their NPC/enemy-style
entries here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Half-Orcs as a people tend to combine the daring and ambition of humans with the
strength and ferocity of orcs. Their build and features are orcish, but their
hair and skin tones resemble those of humans rather than the greens and blues
this edition uses for orcs.</p>

<p>Half-orcs are as numerous as any other people without “half-“ in their
name. They have their own communities and cultures, and also live in more
cosmopolitan settlements along with other sapients. You could play a half-orc
who has neither humans nor orcs anywhere in their family tree, or at least none
in living memory. In fact, they’ve been around in this state for so long that no
one knows their true origins.</p>

<p>There are several competing theories. A more mythical version says that they
arose when Gruumsh lost his eye and his spilled blood hit the world. Another
myth says Kord created them by copying the best elements from his two favorite
species. Others say they started out as a super-soldier experiment by an evil
wizard, or when human and orc barbarian tribes joined in alliance in ancient
times. Another still says they were engineered by the ancient goblin empire to
act as orc wranglers.</p>

<p>And of course, you can still have a half-orc who’s the product of a happy
marriage between a human and an orc. If you really want to you could also make a
half-orc PC with the classic “Unfortunate” origin, but now it’s no longer
exclusive to them. If you really want to play an edgy character, there are
better options around these days.</p>

<p>Another thing that has been removed this edition is the “caught between two
worlds, hated by both” cliche that used to plague both half-elves and
half-orcs. And to that I say good riddance.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>NPC Half-Orcs have the same signature traits as their playable version:
low-light vision, a +2 bonus to speed when charging, and the <strong>Furious Assault</strong>
encounter power. This can be used as a free action right after the half-orc hits
an enemy, and increases the damage of the attack by 1d10. It’s a bit better than
the PC version, which only increases it by 1d8.</p>

<h3 id="half-orc-hunter">Half-Orc Hunter</h3>

<p>A ranger-type who really likes to jump into melee combat, fighting in a reckless
manner. Wearing light armor, they carry a battleaxe and a longbow into combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>axe</strong> and the <strong>bow</strong> are basic attacks, and <strong>Evasive Chop</strong> allows the
hunter to shift 1 square before making an axe attack. <strong>Draw First Blood</strong> is a
passive trait that increases their damage against any enemy who hasn’t yet taken
damage in this fight. Combining it with Furious Assault makes for a good “alpha
strike”.</p>

<h3 id="half-orc-death-mage">Half-Orc Death Mage</h3>

<p>The death mage is more of a priest-type, serving an exarch of Gruumsh named
Yurtrus. Yurtrus presides over disease, misery, and death, so their magic
follows the same themes. Death Mages are always Evil, unlike the others here who
are presented as Unaligned. They wear robes and carry quarterstaffs that work
more as implements than as weapons.</p>

<p>Though they can attack with that <strong>staff</strong>, their main melee attack is a
<strong>rotting touch</strong> that targets Fortitude and does both immediate and ongoing
necrotic damage (save ends). The touch also strips any necrotic resistance or
immunity the target might have! This opens it up to necrotic attacks from
others, and allows that ongoing damage to have an effect. Saving against the
damage also ends this condition.</p>

<p>At range, they can shoot <strong>Bolts of Putrescence</strong> vs. Reflex that deal physical
damage and inflict a -5 penalty to all the target’s defenses for a turn. Their
area attack is a <strong>Swarm of Flies</strong> that deals physical damage and creates a
zone over the affected area. Anyone caught inside takes damage from fly bites,
and has their visibility restricted to 3 squares. The death mage can move the
zone 2 squares as a minor action.</p>

<p>The death mage has the racial Furious Assault power, and it’s worth remembering
that it can enhance <em>any</em> attack, not just physical ones. Its final power is
<strong>Death Mark</strong>, which automatically deals heavy physical damage to whoever
reduces the mage to 0 HP.</p>

<h3 id="half-orc-scarthane">Half-Orc Scarthane</h3>

<p>Scarthanes are veteran warriors that eschew armor and proudly display the
tapestry of scars covering their skin. The more wounded they are, the more
dangerous they become, and either ferocity or blood magic allows them to keep
fighting even through all those wounds.</p>

<p>A Scarthane is a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP, wielding a greataxe and fighting
unarmored. The <strong>axe</strong> is a High-Crit weapon, and they’re limited to basic
attacks and Furious Assault at first.</p>

<p>When the scarthane hits a bloodied target, <strong>Blood for Blood</strong> makes the attack
deal +1d6 damage and heals them for 5 HP.</p>

<p>Once the scarthane becomes bloodied, <strong>Wounded Retaliation</strong> allows them to make
a basic attack against whoever bloodied them. They also gain <strong>Bloodfury
Attack</strong>, an axe attack that lacks the High-Crit property but deals more base
damage and heals the scarthane for 10 HP when it hits. This does stack with
Blood for Blood!</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Half-orcs can be found among humans, orcs, or other creatures that associate
with them. They can easily be reskinned by replacing their signature traits with
those of the target species.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 half-orc hunters, 1 human hexer, 4 human berserkers. A barbarian
hunting party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 4 scarthanes, 1 orc chieftain, 1 orc eye of Gruumsh. The scarthanes
make an excellent honor guard.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Half-elves have been a part of D&amp;D since races were first separated from classes
back in AD&amp;D 1st Edition. I guess they might have been inspired by Elrond from
Lord of the Rings, who was said to be a half-elf. They appeared as a playable
option right in the first PHB, but they’re only getting their monster/NPC
entries here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I’m happy to report that Fourth Edition half-elves no longer follow the tired
and somewhat problematic “outsiders to both parent cultures” narrative from
previous editions! In fact, everyone likes them!</p>

<p>You see, half-elves aren’t just an “average” of their two parents. Yes, they’re
sturdier than elves and pointier than humans, but they also have a lot of traits
that are uniquely their own. Chief among those is a noticeable facility with
social interaction and cultural adaptability.</p>

<p>Half-elves whose parents are a human and an elf can spend their early years in
either of the two cultures, depending on their specific family
circumstances. Their names and mannerisms tend to be taken from that
culture. You can also have all-half-elf cultures and communities whose
human and elven ancestors are several generations behind them. In all cases it’s
very common for individuals to journey abroad for a while out of a sense of
curiosity and wanderlust, and they tend to fit in well in any place where they
linger for a while.</p>

<p>Of course, “Nice” doesn’t necessarily mean “Good”, and you can also find
villainous half-elves who become bandit leaders or fall in with dark
forces. They’re technically better-suited to be infernal warlocks than
<em>tieflings</em>, given their stat adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three stat blocks here, more suitable for use as opposition than as
allies, though they could also fill that role in a more morally ambiguous
adventure.</p>

<p>Half-elves are Medium Natural humanoids, with a native speed of 6 and low-light
vision. Everything else about their stat blocks comes from training.</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-bandit-captain">Half-Elf Bandit Captain</h3>

<p>This could be a murderous marauder or a Robin Hood figure. They’re a level 6
Skirmisher with the Leader keyword and 69 HP. They wear light armor, wield a
sword, and carry a bunch of throwing daggers.</p>

<p>The <strong>sword</strong> is a basic melee attack that allows the captain to shift 1 square
on a hit. Their basic ranged attack is a thrown <strong>dagger</strong>. A maneuver named
<strong>Slash and Dash</strong> (recharge 4+) allows them to make a sword attack, shift 2
squares and throw a dagger. Their leaderly move is named <strong>Triggering Slash</strong>
(recharge 5+), a sword attack that on a hit allows an ally to shift 1 square and
make a melee basic attack of their own.</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-con-artist">Half-Elf Con Artist</h3>

<p>This is a Level 7 Controller with 77 HP. Whether they’re a lovable rogue or a
dastardly deceiver depends on which side of the con you’re on. The con artist
goes unarmored and clad in fine clothes, with a dagger hidden somewhere for
protection. They’re trained in all the skills you’d expect them to have:
Stealth, Bluff, Thievery, and Insight.</p>

<p>That <strong>dagger</strong> isn’t anything special, but it deals extra sneak attack damage
if the con artist has combat advantage against the target. Their real weapon is
<em>manipulation</em>, though. This is implemented as a trio of charm powers that
target Will. It’s up to you whether they’re actual magic or just the con artist
being very sly and convincing.</p>

<p><strong>Deceptive Maneuver</strong> is an at-will melee power that causes the target to make
a melee basic attack against an ally of the half-elf’s choice. The classic
“getting between two enemies to make them hit each other”.</p>

<p><strong>Silver Deception</strong> (ranged 10; recharge 5+) does no damage, but dominates the
target until the end of the con artist’s next turn.</p>

<p>And <strong>Pathetic Appeal</strong> is an encounter power that targets every enemy in a
close burst 5 and, on a hit, prevents them from attacking the con artist until
they pass a save. If the con artist makes an attack roll against an affected
target, they get an immediate extra save against this effect. “I’ve seen the
error of my ways, honest!”</p>

<p>To close things out, <strong>Grifter’s Flight</strong> is another encounter power that allows
the con artist to shift 6 squares and make an unpenalized Stealth check at the
end</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-baleful-thaumaturge">Half-Elf Baleful Thaumaturge</h3>

<p>An epic-level evil wizard for all of your epic-level evil wizard needs. The stat
block itself is Unaligned, so you could also use it to represent a wizard that’s
merely edgy. No reason it has to be a half-elf either, the stats could apply to
any Medium sapient. Their magic has a “blood and teeth” theme, which gives you a
hint as to what kind of entity they learned it from.</p>

<p>The thaumaturge is Level 24 Artillery with 169 HP. They go unarmored, and wield
a wand as an implement. Their basic melee attack is an <strong>Infernal Slam</strong> that
targets Will. A hit damages the target, pushes it 3 squares, and allows the
thaumaturge to teleport 3 squares. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Soul Bite</strong>
spell (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that does physical damage and gives the thaumaturge
10 temporary HP on a hit.</p>

<p>The “bitey” theme continues with their two special attacks. <strong>Wall of Shadow
Teeth</strong> (recharge 5+) creates wall 2 squares high and 8 squares long within 10
squares of the caster. This wall bites, attacking anyone adjacent to it. A hit
deals necrotic damage and immobilizes the target (save ends). It lasts for a
turn but can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<p><strong>Mouths of Hell</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will; encounter) deals heavy psychic
damage and also gives the thaumaturge 10 temporary HP. This creates a zone of
ghostly maws that lasts until the end of the encounter, deals 15 psychic damage
to anyone caught inside, and gives the caster 5 temporary HP when it damages
someone in this way.</p>

<p>The thaumaturge can also spend 5 temporary HP if it has them to teleport 8
squares as a minor action, with a spell called <strong>Bloody Step</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There isn’t much of a theme to the half-elves in this entry, but I guess that’s
the point. They’re as varied as humanity. Each individual entry has their own
thing going.</p>

<p>The two sample encounters we get are a Level 7 one with a bandit captain leading
a gang of humans and halflings, and a Level 25 one with an epic lich and its
entourage of 2 thaumaturges and 2 slaughterstone hammerers.</p>

<p>Here we see something of a rarity in this series: a monster whose 4e incarnation
I find <em>strictly worse</em> than its previous ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gray Renders first appeared in 3e, where they were these big, clawed,
carnivorous brutes with an oddly endearing trait: they would sometimes imprint
on another creature and basically dedicate their lives to protect it and take
care of it. This creature could be a sapient, or even a PC if the GM was feeling
cute.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition gray renders lose the imprinting, and replace it with a constant
urge to destroy and feed. Some sages theorize they’re somehow tied to the
metaphysical concept of entropy despite being natural beasts, since they seem
particularly fond of targetting sapient settlements.</p>

<p>I don’t like this change because, as you might have surmised by now, I’m not
fond of always-hostile, attacks-on-sight-and-fights-to-the-death monsters. I
literally never saw anyone mention grey renders online without also mentioning
and praising the imprinting. Remove that and you’re left with something that’s
virtually indistinguishable from, say, a goristro demon.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gray Renders are Large Natural Humanoids with a Chaotic Evil alignment and
Int 2. They’re Level 19 Elite Brutes with 452 HP and blindsight, who fight using
claws, bites, and sheer brutality. In other words, almost like slightly smaller,
slightly dumber goristros with blindsight. They have Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong> that also grabs on a hit. They can make
two claw attacks per action, and if both hit the same target they also inflict
ongoing damage on account of the rending. They can use a grabbed victim as a
club, inflicting more damage than the claw, pushing the target of the attack 4
squares from the impact, and dealing half the rolled damage to the “weapon”. Or
they can bite the grabbed victim for massive damage, with a Daze rider.</p>

<p>While bloodied, their claw attack also knocks a target prone on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Gray renders are said to be too destructive to cooperate with anyone, but some
predators and scavengers have taken to following them from safe distance to
exploit their rampages. So we get these encounter groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 gray render, 1 bodak skulk, 2 guulvorgs. Opportunistic followers
can be sapient too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 dire bullette, 1 gray render, 3 nabassu gargoyles. The gargoyles
are watching the kaiju battle and waiting to feast on the loser’s remains.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The stat block is cool, but the lore is “meh” at best. Reskin this into a demon
and/or add the imprinting back to make it more interesting.</p>

            <p>I think Goliaths first appeared in the Races of Stone supplement for 3.5. In
Fourth Edition, their first appearance was as a playable option in the
PHB 2. They get their corresponding “monster” entry here, with a couple of stat
blocks suitable for use as opposition or NPC allies.</p>

<p>They’re one of the many playable peoples designed to give players a “taste” of
being a cool fantasy monster without being unbalanced. Eladrin arguably do it
for Sidhe; dragonborn do it for dragons; tieflings for fiends; deva for
angels. Goliaths do it for giants.</p>

<p>The typical goliath is stated to be between 7 and 8 feet tall, so whether
they’re on the large side of Medium or the small side of Large is a matter of
opinion. The book’s opinion is that they’re Medium, since that allows them to be
playable. Their skin is gray or brown, and speckled with coin-sized bony growths
that look like rocks.</p>

<p>Goliaths have existed since shortly after the Primordials created the world,
which might mean they’re a kind of byproduct of the creation of the Giants in
the same way the origin of the Dragonborn is tied to that of dragons. Goliaths
don’t care enough about that to make myths about it, though.</p>

<p>All throughout their history they’ve preferred to keep to a nomadic existence in
the more mountainous areas of the world, so there isn’t much about them in other
people’s records either. While it’s fairly common for individual goliaths to
travel the “lowlands” as adventurers or explorers, they haven’t engaged in any
grand diplomacy or empire-building as a people.</p>

<p>Culturally, goliaths place a lot of value in individual skill and prowess, and
this makes them very competitive. Their communities probably have all sorts of
tournaments and contests in their calendars. Individual goliaths tend to turn
everything into a contest, even if only in the privacy of their own minds - they
keep score and constantly compare themselves both to their companions and to
their own past performance. That battle where Legolas and Gimli compare their
kill counts? That’s every fight where a goliath is involved. This does have the
downside of making them get a bit depressive when they fail to measure up to
their own standards.</p>

<p>I suspect Kord is a very popular deity among goliaths, and they also often
worship the primal spirits.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As far as the rules are concerned, Goliaths are Medium Natural Humanoids. They
have a natural speed of 6, and human-equivalent senses. Their signature ability
is <strong>Stone’s Endurance</strong>, a minor-action encounter power which gives them
some resistance to all damage for a turn. The value of this resistance is 5/tier
(5 at heroic, 10 at paragon, 15 at epic).</p>

<h3 id="goliath-sunspeaker">Goliath Sunspeaker</h3>

<p>This is more of a primal priest of the sun spirits than a cleric of Pelor,
focused on burning people with sun-powered lasers. Sunspeakers are Level 7
Artillery with 64 HP, wearing light armor and using an orb as an implement.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is the <strong>Sunspeaker’s Hand</strong>, which targets Reflex and
deals light radiant damage. <strong>Solar Sphere</strong> does the same at Range 20 with
better damage.</p>

<p>Less often, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Solar Rays</strong> (recharge 4+) against up to 2
targets within Range 10. This deals light radiant <em>or</em> fire damage, as well as
ongoing damage of the type chosen (save ends). This allows them to potentially
stack two sources of ongoing damage on someone with the same power.</p>

<p>If cornered, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Flaring Leap</strong> (move action; encounter) to
jump 3 squares and then move its remaining speed. This jet-powered jump causes a
fire in the sunspeaker’s starting space, which deals damage to adjacent enemies
or to those foolish enough to enter the flaming square. The fire lasts for a
turn and can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use a big area attack named <strong>Call Down The Sun</strong> once per
encounter, which is a bit weaker than Solar Sphere but targets a lot of people
and does half damage on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-guardian">Goliath Guardian</h3>

<p>A more straightforward but no less powerful martial type. The guardian is a
Level 9 Soldier with 96 HP. It’s heavily armored by still has speed 6, wielding
a bastard sword and a light shield.</p>

<p>Its basic <strong>sword</strong> attack marks for a turn, and if the target is prone it’s
also prevented from getting up for the same amount of time. The guardian knocks
people prone with <strong>Ram’s Charge</strong> (recharge 5+), a maneuver that deals light
physical damage and has a long list of riders: it pushes the target 2 squares,
knocks it prone, and allows the goliath to make a free sword attack against the
target. As the name says, it can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Warrior’s Leap</strong> is a passive that allows the guardian to jump
without provoking opportunity attacks. It still uses the standard jump rules
(and it’s high Athletics score) for that.</p>

<p>Guardians are awesome in moutainous terrain that’s full of cliffs. Even if their
targets aren’t thrown overboard, they’ll still stay on the ground for quite a
while, granting advantage to the guardian and any sneak-attacking skirmisher
buddies.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Goliaths often team up with similarly-inclined mountain-dwellers, which can
include dwarves, galeb duhrs, or goblins. I suppose that might include stone
giants as well, if you level your goliaths up a bit. The sample encounter is
level 9, and includes a galeb duhr rock-caller, 3 goliath guardians, and 1
sunspeaker.</p>

<p>I like goliaths, they fill a very specific “huge person” niche. These two stat
blocks are interesting from a mechanics standpoint as well.</p>
