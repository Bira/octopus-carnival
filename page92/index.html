<p>Energy shields are a popular science fiction trope, appearing in enough stories
to feature in GURPS Ultra-Tech as Force Screens and Force Shields. However, I
didn’t have a very clear idea of how they worked until recently.</p>

<p>The text describing them is a bit… fuzzy, probably because this was one of the
first supplements written for GURPS Fourth Edition. The “real” explanation makes
sense, but it does require quite a bit more deduction, research and/or knowing
the rules by heart than latter additions to the system. To make it easier on
you, here’s the complete picture of how GURPS Force Screens work, to the best of
my knowledge:</p>

<p>GURPS Force Screens come in “Barrier” and “Conformal” varieties, where the first
represents the sort of shields used by starships or cities, and the second
represents the kind worn by individuals and very common in video games. They
both work the same way rules-wise.</p>

<p>Force Screens provide DR to the person or thing they protect (the “user”). They
protect all of the user’s hit locations, even the eyes. Anything that hits the
user must contend with the force screen’s DR first, separate from any other DR
from armor. Every 10 points of rolled damage from the attack reduces force
screen DR by 1, whether it penetrates or not. Force Screens regenerate 10% of
their lost DR every second.</p>

<p>In short, they work exactly like DR (Force Field +20%, Semi-Ablative -10%), with
Regeneration (Very Fast) applied to their DR instead of the user’s HP.</p>

<p>Armor-piercing attacks apply their armor divisor both against the screen’s DR
<em>and</em> against the number of damage points needed to ablate it. This was the hard
bit to figure out! People have been asking questions about this for years
according to <a href="https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Divisor">this source</a>.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Tom Tomorrow is a hero transported straight from the pages of pulp space opera
to modern-day Paragon City. He fights crime with the help of his raygun, armored
space suit (DR 30/15*), and personal force screen projector (DR 60).</p>

<p>The Robber Baron is at it again, robbing the First National Bank. Tom Tomorrow
arrives ot save the day, and the Baron shoots him with his pistol. The gun does
2d+2 pi damage, and its average damage roll of 9 is certainly not enough to get
past Tom’s force screen. In fact, it would take 2 shots to reduce the screen’s
DR by 1, and it would recover soon afterwards. The Baron has no means of harming
Tom, making this an easy arrest.</p>

<p>Some time later, the Baron escapes jail and tries to rob the Second National
Bank. Tom intervenes again, and this time the baron fires at him with an assault
rifle! The weapon does 5d pi damage and has a RoF of 12. Its average damage roll
of 18 means a single shot can’t penetrate the force screen, but it does reduce
its DR by 1. Assuming all shots hit, a second of sustained fire would lower the
screen’s DR by 21. 6 of those points would return at the start of each turn, and
it would take about three seconds before any bullets started getting through. Of
course, it’s rare for all shots in a 12-round burst to hit and Tom isn’t just
going to stand there, so the screen still makes him much safer than a mundane
police officer would be. He manages to arrest the Baron once again.</p>

<p>Yet more time later the Baron escapes <em>again</em> and tries to rob the Third
National Bank. This time, when Tom arrives to stop him, the baron shoots him
with an antitank grenade from his rifle’s brand new underbarrel launcher. The
grenade does 4d(10) cr ex damage, with an average roll of 14. The screen
protects against this with DR 6, and loses 14 points of DR from the attack. 8
damage get through to Tom’s armored space suit. It would normally protect
against crushing damage with DR 15, but the armor divisor still applies, so it
only protects against this blast with DR 1. Tom takes 7 points of damage and is
visibly staggered and bloodied. Oh no! Can he defeat the Robber Baron this time?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Force Screens are good protection against single attacks, and give you something
of a safety buffer against sustained fire from multiple sources. Anything that’s
good at getting through physical armor will get through them just as well,
though, and deplete them faster.</p>

<p>Pretty much every weapon available at the same TL as force screens will have an
armor divisor of at least 3, and more often 5 or 10, so their DR is going to
ablate at a faster rate than you might think from looking at them in
isolation. Against lower-tech weapons, though, even the belt-mounter personal
force screen is enough to make its user as hard to take down as a lightly
armored vehicle.</p>

<p>In a future article I’m going to look at how to tweak GURPS force screens to
make them work a bit more like video-game shields.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way right now: behemoths are dinosaurs. Dinosaurs have
been a feature of D&amp;D at least since the X1 module for BECMI, but as far as I
know the new nomenclature is new in Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>While I don’t know for sure why the authors decided on the name change, I can
speculate. On Earth we call dinosaurs by Latin/Greek scientific names because we
only known them through scientific studies - the creatures themselves became
extinct millions of years ago.</p>

<p>The world of D&amp;D, however, is not Earth! They never spoke any Latin or Greek
there. And in the setting implied by the Monster Manual, <em>dinosaurs never went
extinct</em>. So naturally people who interact with them would come up with
common-usage names for them. Another benefit of the alternate nomenclature might
be that it frees authors to diverge from currently accepted science a bit. I’ve
seen people get strict about it when the “dinosaur” terminology starts getting
thrown arround, even in D&amp;D monster books.</p>

<p>The two behemoths presented in the first Monster Manual are described as
omnivirous reptiles that live in herds and use their size and ferocity to drive
out threats and rivals. Both are Large Natural Beasts, with the “reptile”
keyword and Int 2. “Reptile” doesn’t come with any attached mechanics (like
“aquatic” does), but I imagine some other monsters might have powers that
interact with it. They’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="macetail-behemoth">Macetail Behemoth</h2>

<p>This one resembles a real-world ankylosaurus. D&amp;D macetails are ill-tempered and
territorial on the wild, but if raised from hatchlings they can be domesticated
for use as pack animals. They’re Level 7 Soldiers with 82 HP, and fight with
their tails. Their basic attack is a Tail Bludgeon that marks, and they can
sweep their tails on a Close burst 1 that targets Reflex, and knocks Medium or
smaller targets prone on a hit (in addition to doing damage). The sweep
recharges on 4-6.</p>

<p>The specification that the targets must be Medium or smaller is a bit
unusual. After all, that covers every possible PC, so it’s theoretically
unnecessary. I imagine it’s there in case the PCs have their own domesticated
behemoths or other giant allies on their side.</p>

<h2 id="bloodspike-behemoth">Bloodspike Behemoth</h2>

<p>AKA stegosaurus. Also fiercely territorial, with an even fouler mood than the
macetail. Even domesticated bloodspikes (used to pull heavy loads or siege
engines) are difficult to train and control.</p>

<p>They’re level 9 Brutes with 118 HP, and also fight with their tails. The basic
Spiked Tail attack does ongoing damage, and they also have the same Tail Sweep
attack as the macetails. In addition to the usual Recharge 4-6 on the sweep,
they get to do another one as a free action when first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 7 and has a troop of troglodytes
(shaman+muscle) using a macetail behemoth as armored support. It’s a all-reptile
theme group!</p>

<p>Personally, I’d also add behemoths to human or elven forces. Maybe that merchant
caravan you were hired to protect is a train of macetails instead of the mules
you’d normally expect, and when brigands attack keeping the beasts from going
berserk is as much of a challenge as the fight itself.</p>

<p>It’s true! I mean, it’s common for fantasy settings to have items made of one or
more fantastic materials in them, but Tamriel (the setting of Skyrim and other
Elder Scrolls games) goes the extra mile by naming its selection after
completely different real-world materials. So you get things like high-end armor
made from “refined malachite”, which in our world is also known as “copper”.</p>

<p>GURPS takes a more realistic approach, so when adapting this stuff to GURPS you
need to modify it a little. Here are some Tamrielic cultures written in a format
similar to the one shown in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasures 1: Glittering
Prizes</strong>, and slightly modified to fit better with GURPS DF. Page references
are given for published game effects, and full stats are given to new ones.</p>

<p>I’m mostly basing myself on Skyrim here, since that’s what I played the
most. Any differences between the material below and official lore can be either
born of my ignorance of the overall setting or a change I made on purpose to fit
what I find interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-nords-of-skyrim">The Nords of Skyrim</h2>

<p>These are pretty much your standard off-brand Vikings. Nords were some of the
first humans to arrive on the continent of Tamriel, sailing into frosty Skyrim
from even frostier Altmora thousands of years ago. They typically value martial
prowess and distrust magic, though there are also plenty of peaceful or
mystically-inclined Nords.</p>

<p>Present-day Nord artisans usually disdain fancy or “impossible” materials,
placing greater value on the skill that goes into making an object. Clothing is
sturdy, warm, and predominantly made of wool and cotton. Fancier attire tends to
be quilted, vividly dyed and/or trimmed with fur. Jewelry consists of rings,
chains or amulets made from precious metals and often jeweled. Cold-weather gear
made mostly from furs is also a common sight.</p>

<p>Weapons and armor are mostly made from plain old steel. Nords like one-handed
swords and axes, usually wielded with round medium shields. Spears (1- or
2-handed) are also popular, with regular and long bows being the premier ranged
weapons. Armor tends to be mail, scale or plate, and is often fur-lined for
extra protection against the cold. This gear is commonly decorated with carved
reliefs of spiral patterns, or with motifs depicting wolves, bears and
eagles. Nords love horned helmets, though they prefer the look of curled ram
horns rather than the straight ones usually depicted in more cliche Viking
imagery.</p>

<p><em>Ancient</em> Nords were similar, though they were bigger fans of magic. Many
ancient weapons that survive to this day are enchanted or feature “impossible”
embellishments like solid quicksilver inlays. Some ancient Nord smiths even made
weapons and armor entirely from that material. Ancient Nord decoration often
features a dragon motif in addition to the others present in modern day items.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Fur-Lined</strong>: Fur-lined armor acts as winter clothing, removing HT penalties to
resist FP loss from cold. Even if the GM isn’t using detailed rules for that,
they can still declare that such protection is required to enter particularly
inhospitable places (like the Ice Caverns of the Frost Wyrm). +1 CF.</p>

<p>Most Nord gear has no inherent CF or reaction modifier, particularly in a
campaign set in Skyrim or whatever your world’s own Nord-land is. Fine-quality
and Ornate +1 gear is relatively common, though.</p>

<h2 id="high-elves">High Elves</h2>

<p>The High Elves of Tamriel, also known as the Altmer, enthusiastically live up to
every “snobby elf” stereotype. As a culture, they see themselves as direct
descendants of the gods, trapped in mortal flesh when the world was
created. This often manifests of a disdain for the other, more “worldly”
peoples, and as a distressing tendency to form ruthless elven supremacist
organizations.</p>

<p>Unlike the Nords, High Elves go all in on using fancy or impossible materials
for everyday items. Clothing tends towards regal robes of elaborately woven and
dyed silk with gold thread embroidery, featuring wing, bird, and solar
motifs. Gold jewelry is prized, particularly rings, earrings and hair
ornaments. “Fake it till you make it” is the order of the day among high elves
that can’t afford the genuine article.</p>

<p>Elven armorers eschew ferrous metals in favor of bronze, and will prefer to use
more “magical” substances like refined moonstone or tempered glass if they can
get their hands on them. Their preferred weaponry runs to fencing weapons and
fancy polearms, as well as composite bows. For armor they like shiny mail and
light plate suits. Wings and solar disks or rays are also common decorative
motifs for elven armor and weapons, either carved in relief or inlaid in gold or
solid quicksilver. Gilding is also quite popular.</p>

<p>Note that the leven of ornamentation of a piece of elven gear doesn’t have
anything to do with its quality - it’s quite common for very ornate pieces to be
of otherwise standard quality.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-1">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Altmer bows and mail armor always carry the <strong>Elven</strong> modifier. Elven “mail”
here is actually light plate armor. It has the same DR and weight, and can have
modifiers that apply to plate armor.</p>

<p><strong>Bronze</strong>: In Dungeon Fantasy bronze weapons and armor have exactly the same
stats and price as their steel equivalents. They’re just, well,
bronze-colored.</p>

<p><strong>Refined Moonstone</strong>: Magically reinforced aluminum! This is an “implausible
material” like those found on DF 8 or DF Treasures 1. It’s conductive but not
flammable. Items made of refined moonstone have a silvery, pearlescent color. +4
CF.</p>

<p><strong>Tempered Glass</strong>: This is described in DF 8 for weapons. Plate or scale armor
can also be made of tempered glass. Such armor has +6 CF, is neither flammable
nor conductive, and makes you look like you’re wearing a Tiffany lamp.</p>

<p>High Elven gear has no inherent CF modifier, though it’s usually expensive
because of all the ornamentation it carries. In places and times where those
elven supremacist organizations are around, wearing Altmer gear gets you a -2
reaction penalty from pretty much everyone. Unless you happen to be a High Elf
yourself, in which case other High Elves (only) will not react at a penalty.</p>

<h2 id="dark-elves">Dark Elves</h2>

<p>The Dark Elves of Tamriel, also known as Dunmer, hail from the distant
ash-choked plains of Morrowind, a place with little metal but plenty of
monstrous giant bugs. As such, many of their durable goods tend to be made out
of chitin and bone rather than metal or stone.</p>

<p>Dunmer clothing is made out of tough fabric, dyed in drab or dark tones. Fancier
outfits are more colorful and have arabesque patterns made using embroidery or
block printing, and might include elaborate hats. Weapons and armor are made out
of expertly molded chitin or bone more often than they’re made of metal, and
it’s pretty much inevitable that they’ll be “decorated” do look like bugs or
skeletons due to that.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-2">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Chitin</strong>: Chitin armor tends to be smooth and slightly shiny, and is usually
brown or black in color. There’s a bewildering variety of giant bugs in
Morrowind, so any leather, scale or plate armor can be made from chitin. +1 CF.</p>

<p><strong>Bone</strong>: Described in DF 8 and DF Treasures 1.</p>

<p>Items of Dunmer make have no inherent CF modifiers. People unfamiliar with
chitin and bone armor might react to the wearer at -1 or worse.</p>

<h2 id="the-dwarves">The Dwarves</h2>

<p>There are no Dwarves in Tamriel. For some reason the whole civilization just up
and vanished centuries ago, leaving behind a whole lot of ruins filled with
automaton guardians and other still-functioning machinery.</p>

<p>There isn’t any dwarf clothing left to describe - as far as the surviving
accounts go, no one saw them wear anything but heavy armor. Dwarven weapons and
armor, as well as most of their durable goods, are made of an advanced metal
alloy no one else knows how to produce. It can be molded in a standard forge
just fine, though. This makes raiding dwarven ruins for their metal fittings a
profitable, if risky, endeavor. All of these items are often decorated with
engraved geometric patterns made out of straight lines. Ancient dwarven helmets
look like sculpted faces - in fact, people in full dwarven plate don’t look much
different than one of their constructs.</p>

<p>Dwarves seem to have favored one-handed maces and axes, used with heavy metal
shields. For ranged combat, they used crossbows of varying complexity.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-3">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Dwarven weapons and armor always have the <strong>Dwarven</strong> modifier where
applicable. Genuine Dwarven antiques can be sold at an extra +3 CF to
collectors.</p>

<h2 id="the-orcs">The Orcs</h2>

<p>Elder Scrolls Orcs are not considered monsters, and have been a part of
civilized society for a long time. Still, they love fighting even more than
Nords do, and a significant percentage of them are devout worshippers of the God
of Having a Chip on Your Shoulder.</p>

<p>Traditional orc clothing is made from light and breathable fabrics, dyed in
bright colors and some times adorned with quilting or embroidery. Brimless
cylindrical hats are commonly worn by men. “Hardcore” orcs go live in isolated
enclaves where they embrace the “Barbarian Hero” aesthetic of crude hide and
canvas tunics and loincloths. Both types of orc take immense pride in their
ability to craft weapons and armor, though.</p>

<p>Orcs favor nasty serrated blades as weapons, and elaborate suits of plate for
armor - preferrably spiked. The more ornate versions have extensive and
elaborate arabesque reliefs. Orc armorers never use exotic materials solely for
decoration, but they have great love for meteoric iron and orichalcum due to
their useful properties. Orcs take their smithing quite seriously, and orc-made
gear has a higher than usual chance of being Fine-quality or better.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-4">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Orc gear has no inherent CF modifier or reaction bonus.</p>

<p>Serrated weapons are presented in DF Treasures 1, and spiked armor is in DF 1 or
Adventurers.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Monstrous beetles are some of the most traditional opposition for low-level
adventurers, so it’s no surprise they show up here. I was sure they’d have an
entry in the Monster Vault, but it turns out they’re MM-only. We get three
monstrous beetles in this entry, all of them Unaligned and possessed of Int 1,
the minimum possible value.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Beetles</strong> are the most traditional beetles of all. In my experience their
name often made people think they had some sort of fire attack in previous
editions, but it actually referred to the fact that they glow. Well, here they
finally get their fire attack!</p>

<p>4e Fire Beetles are Small Natural Beasts and Level 1 Brutes with 32 HP. They
bite and can use a Fire Spray (recharge 5-6) that does fire damage in a Close
Blast 3. Defensively, they have Resist 10 Fire. And yes, you can still extract
the glowing glands from a dead fire beetle and use them as torches.</p>

<p><strong>Tangler Beetles</strong> are one of the many beasts often tamed by humanoids and used
as guard animals. They’re Large Natural Beasts and Level 5 Controllers with 62
HP. They have a bite basic attack, and a ranged Entangling Spittle attack that
does no damage but immobilizes the target.</p>

<p><strong>Rot Scarab Swarms</strong> are the first swarm monster we’ve run into in this book,
and are a good showcase of the swarm rules. Individually, they’re
normal-beetle-sized and native to areas tainted by the Shadowfell (making them
shadow beasts).</p>

<p>The scarab swarm counts as a single Medium creature, a Level 8 Soldier. It has a
Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make free basic attacks against anyone who
begins their turn caught in it. That basic attack is a necrotic “Swarm of Bites”
that also does ongoing necrotic damage, and they get to attack normally in their
action as well. They take half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and 10
extra damage from close (burst/blast) and area attacks.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 1, a trio of kobolds and their two pet fire
beetles.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like that Fire Beetles finally get a fire attack. I seem to remember them
having one in Neverwinter Nights, but I’m not sure if they had one in actual 3.x
D&amp;D. I’m fairly sure they didn’t have it earlier than that.</p>

<p>Rot Scarabs are a nicely creepy addition to a crypt-themed dungeon. They’re
undead-adjacent but not undead themselves, so I guess encountering them can be
somewhat surprising for PCs. Including them in a fight against undead is a good
way to make sure the cleric can’t shut the whole opposing force down with a
single turning attempt.</p>

<p>We have bears in the real world, so they don’t require much in the way of
introduction. D&amp;D has always included a variety of bears in its bestiaries,
their various real-world species lending themselves well to the “pallette swap”
approach preferred by its older editions.</p>

<p>After going through a few Monster Manual-only entries, we finally arrive at one
that exists in both books. The Monster Vault has an appendix with stats for
mundane animals, likely a response to complaints from traditionalist players
that the original Monster Manuals didn’t include any.</p>

<p>But wait! If the Monster Manual doesn’t have anything on mundane animals, what
does it say about bears? Let’s find out.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>They’re bears. Large, omnivorous, inhabit temperate or colder areas. I wasn’t
aware of it until recently, but it appears the “Bear Lore” entry in the Monster
Manual is kind of a running joke among 4e players. It’s structured just like the
lore entries for weirder monsters, so it ends up telling us a PC needs to
succeed at a DC 20 Nature check to know that bears attack with their
claws.</p>

<p>IIRC, while real-life bears can be dangerous, they usually don’t go out of their
way to attack humans, so most bear encounters will be peaceful. Of course, this
being D&amp;D, you can encounter some bears that don’t exist in real life and that
are far more ornery.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Combining the two books gives us three different bears: a mundane Bear (MV), a
Cave Bear (MM), and the ever spiky Dire Bear (both). All are Unaligned natural
beasts and have Int 2.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bear</strong> likely represents a brown bear. It’s Large, and a Level 5 Brute
with 80 HP. It attacks with its claws, and can use a Bear Grab about twice per
fight (it recharges when the bear is bloodied). This allows it to make two claw
attacks against the same target, and if either one hits the target drops prone
and the bear grabs it <em>if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed</em>. This ain’t
no normal bear hug. At the start of the bear’s turn, it deals automatic damage
against any creatures it has grabbed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Cave Bear</strong> is meant to represent a species that’s extinct in our
world. It’s a Level 6 Elite Brute with 170 HP, but for some reason it’s only
Medium. It’s more of a striker than a grappler: aside from its claws, it has a
Cave Bear Frenzy that does claw damage in a Close Burst 1 and recharges on a
5-6. That’s a bit less multi-strike ability than I’d expect from an elite
monster, but not too much less.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dire Bear</strong> follows the “bigger and spikier” theme set for dire animals in
Third Edition. The Monster Vault version is merely an update of the Monster
Manual, so I recommend using that one in all cases. It’s a Large Natural Beast
and a Level 11 Elite Brute. Its basic attack are its claws, but it will rarely
use that. The Dire Bear’s real go-to ability is Maul, which is at-will and
allows it to make two claw attacks. If both hit the same target, the bear grabs
the target if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed. This grab requires a
secondary attack in the MM version, but not in the MV one. The bear can also use
a standard action to deal lots of automatic damage to a grabbed creature (that’s
where you use its action point).</p>

<p>Suggested encounters in the MM are: Level 6, two cave bears and one bugbear
strangler (“us bears gotta stick together!”); and level 11, 1 dire bear, 1 ettin
spirit-talker, and 3 ogre minions.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions.</h2>

<p>Well, they’re bears. While there’s nothing terribly exciting about them
lore-wise, they do their job mechanically (particularly the Monster Vault
variants).</p>

<p>One thing that might be fun is to have an evil druid as a villain, using charmed
bears to do his bidding. Have the party be on the receiving end of the
Aggressively Hegemonizing Ursine Swarm for once.</p>
