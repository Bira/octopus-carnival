<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Elementals have been part of D&amp;D since its very beginnings. Their basic
definition has remained the same throughout: they’re living aglomerations of
elemental matter who often take roughly humanoid forms and have powers related
to their constituent element. They often get summoned by wizards to fight their
enemies, or can be found either as bound guards or as fantasy wildlife.</p>

<p>In earlier editions, you had your four classic elemental planes: Fire, Air,
Water, Earth. They were pretty much composed entirely of their naming element
and were basically places to summon elementals from, since nothing else could
live there. AD&amp;D and its Great Wheel cosmology added a bunch of “quasi-“ and
“para-“ elemental planes that served as sources of more exotic
elementals. You know how it goes: water and fire equals steam, so there’s a
steam plane that’s home to steam elementals, and so on.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition instead has the Elemental Chaos, which we already looked at when
talking about demons. It contains <em>all</em> elements, whether they’re the classic
four or some of the other mixes. It’s also a lot more interesting in that it’s
possible for PC adventurers to go there and have adventures in fantastic and
varied landscapes without much in the way of magical life support. It has entire
cities and civilizations of creatures with the Elemental origin.</p>

<p>And it also has small-e elementals! Their basic nature remains the same, and
they make up much of the “wildlife” of the Elemental Chaos, but much like their
new home plane they can be made up of multiple elements. In fact, 4e went so
hard for these amalgam beings that traditionalist players began to complain that
they never saw plain old single-substance elementals any more. The classics
would finally appear in the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Elementals don’t necessarily band together by element type. Many of them follow
orders from more powerful beings from the Elemental Chaos such as efreets and
titans, and will form up in whatever way their orders require. “Wild” elementals
do like to stick together with others who share one or more of their elements
though.</p>

<p>Let’s look first at the Monster Manual elementals, then at the Monster Vault
ones.</p>

<h2 id="monster-manual-elementals">Monster Manual Elementals</h2>

<p>The MM gives us four elementals, all two-element and with levels spanning the
paragon and early epic tier. As usual, the reasoning for these levels is that
the Elemental Chaos is a place you explore when you hit paragon tier, and so
these creatures are a sample of what might oppose you once you’re there. All of
them are Large Elemental Magical Beasts, with keywords corresponding to their
constituent elements. They have Int scores between 6 and 8, so they’re not
mindless but not geniuses either.</p>

<h3 id="firelasher">Firelasher</h3>

<p>Made of Air and Fire, the firelasher looks like a fire whirlwind with long, thin
tentacles for arms. It’s a Level 11 Skirmisher with 108 HP, immune to disease
and poison, and with fire resistance 25. It flies with speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is the titular fire lash (Melee 2 vs. Reflex, fire
damage). It also has a special attack named Wildfire Cyclone (Close Burst 2
vs. Reflex, recharge 5-6). This does fire damage on a hit, in addition to
pushing the targets and knocking them prone. On a miss, it still does half
damage. And it can also make a Whirlwind Dash, which allows it to fly <em>twice</em>
its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and deal 10 automatic fire
damage against anyone whose squares they fly through. This recharges on a 6 and
will likely be used whenever available.</p>

<p>This one pairs very well with other creatures that are resistant to fire, since
it won’t need to worry about hurting them with its Whirlwind Dash.</p>

<h3 id="rockfire-dreadnought">Rockfire Dreadnought</h3>

<p>Sitting at the other end of Paragon Tier, this Earth and Fire beast is a Level
18 Soldier with 170 HP. It’s immune to disease, petrification and poison, and
has Resist 25 fire. It runs at speed 8.</p>

<p>This one really feels like it should be a Brute, because it has two very simple
attacks: the Fist of Flame (basic, Melee 2 vs. Reflex, fire damage) and a
chucked Brimstone Rock (Ranged 10/20 vs. AC, physical and fire damage). No
marks, no additional riders.</p>

<h3 id="earthwind-ravager">Earthwind Ravager</h3>

<p>A cyclone full of rocks! It’s a Level 23 Controller with 219 HP. It’s immune to
disease, petrification and poison, and flies with speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>The ravager’s basic attack is a simple Slam (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude, physical
damage). It can also trap a victim in a Wind Devil (Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude). This does some damage on a hit and immobilized the victim for a
turn. It can also be sustained with a minor action, causing the victim to remain
immobilized for another turn and take some automatic damage.</p>

<p>The ravager can also surround itself with a Whirlwind (Close Burst 1
vs. Fortitude) which does damage and pushes targets 2 squares on a hit. And
finally it can use a Buffeting Blast (Close Blast 3 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5-6)
which does damage and stuns for a turn if it hits.</p>

<p>One of your PCs <em>will</em> remain immobilized for the duration of the combat unless
they can stop the ravager from spending that minor action every
round. Immobilized PCs are of course prime targets for the Buffeting Blast.</p>

<h3 id="thunderblast-cyclone">Thunderblast Cyclone</h3>

<p>To close it out we have a living storm made of Air and Water. It’s Level 26
Elite Artillery with 382 HP, and Huge instead of Large. Immune to disease and
poison, it also has Resist 30 to lightning and thunder and a fly speed of 10
(hover).</p>

<p>This elemental has two basic attacks, a Reach 3 Lightning Arc and a Range 10
Lightning Bolt, both of which target Reflex and do lightning damage. It can also
emit Thunderclaps (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude) that cause thunder damage.</p>

<p>When cornered, it can respond by generating a Charged Mist in a Close Burst 3,
which hits automatically for some lightning damage and turns the creature
insubstantial for a turn. Insubstantial creatures can still be hit by attacks,
but they halve all damage they take (including ongoing damage).</p>

<p>Using Charged Mist also charges up the Lightning Storm power (Area Burst 3
Within 20 vs. Reflex), which does a generous amount of thunder and lightning
damage, half on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="monster-vault-elementals">Monster Vault Elementals</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault tries to address some long-standing criticism from those
traditionalists I mentioned at the start of this post: that the good old
single-element quartet was nowhere to be seen, and that there were few
elementals suitable for low-level adventurers.</p>

<p>It presents us with four entries, the Lesser Elementals of Air, Earth, Fire and
Water. They’re all level 1 or 2, and Small in size. Presumably there’s a
3.x-like progression of increasingly powerful traditional elementals, but those
are left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-air-elemental">Lesser Air Elemental</h3>

<p>This Level 1 Lurker has 23 HP, flies with speed 6 (hover), and has Vulnerable 5
fire for some reason. It has a passive trait named Phantom on the Wind, which
makes it automatically turn invisible whenever it starts its turn without an
enemy adjacent to it. This lasts for a turn or until the elemental makes an
attack.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a relatively weak slam. Its main trick is the Grasp of
Storms (Melee 1 vs. Reflex), which can only target creatures that can’t see the
air elemental. A hit does more damage than the slam and grabs the target (escape
DC 12). Grabbed targets take 5 ongoing damage and absorb half the damage of any
attack directed against the monster while the grab lasts. Only one victim at a
time can be grabbed.</p>

<p>A whole pack of these striking from ambush would be Fun (TM), particularly if
they manage to grab multiple PCs. More powerful versions, in addition to being
bigger and having a higher level, could probably turn Grasp of Storms into a
close burst and be able to maintain more grabs at once.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-earth-elemental">Lesser Earth Elemental</h3>

<p>This Level 2 Soldier has 42 HP. It walks and burrows at speed 5, and has
Tremorsense 5, allowing to sense anyone in that radius as long as they’re in
contact with the ground or a wall.</p>

<p>Its Earth Glide trait allows it to phase through earth and rock at will, and its
Brittle Skin trait means it takes a -2 to its defenses for a turn if it takes
any thunder damage.</p>

<p>Its only attack is a slam, which does damage as usual and prevents hit targets
from shifting for a turn. There’s also the Overwhelming Stone ability, which
triggers when a nearby enemy hits one of the elemental’s allies with a melee
attack. The elemental automatically knocks the attacker prone! This recharges
once the elemental is first bloodied.</p>

<p>More powerful versions can probably use Overwhelming Stone more often, and
likely turn it into an attack that can do damage.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-fire-elemental">Lesser Fire Elemental</h3>

<p>A Level 1 Skirmisher with 27 HP, the lesser file elemental runs at speed 8 and
flies at speed 4 (clumsy). Its passive traits mean it cannot shift for a turn if
it takes cold damage, and causes 3 damage to anyone who misses it with a melee
attack.</p>

<p>Its slam attack targets Reflex is remarkable for not doing any immediate
damage - it only does ongoing fire damage (save ends). Lesser fire elementals
can also shift as a minor action instead of a move one.</p>

<p>More powerful versions should likely add immediate fire damage to their melee
attacks, and more damage on missed attacks.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-water-elemental">Lesser Water Elemental</h3>

<p>A Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, the lesser water elemental walks and swims with
speed 6. It is of course Aquatic, and taking cold damage causes it to take 5
extra damage from the next attack that hits it.</p>

<p>Its slam does relatively little immediate damage, but also does ongoing 5
damage. I guess it fills the target’s lungs with water. It also has an encounter
power called Whelm (Close Blast 3 vs. Fortidude, affects only enemies). On a hit
this does damage, pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the elemental can slide each creature taking ongoing damage
from its slam by 1 square as it uses the water in their lungs to push them
around.</p>

<p>More powerful versions likely can use Whelm more often and perhaps have it cause
ongoing damage as well.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM has two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: A firelasher and a bunch of yuan-ti cultists, placing the elemental
as summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: A rockfire dreadnaught, 2 fire giants, and a mind flayer
mastermind. I guess ol’ squidface managed to snag himself some beefy thralls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for the MV lessers, I guess it’s actually possible to fight all four of them
at once, as they don’t actually get in each other’s way! I’d likely add a second
air elemental to make it a proper five-monster band. You can also add them to
any band of low-level opponents that include a spellcaster who could plausibly
summon them.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I’ve already talked about eladrin in passing when discussing drow, and now I’m
going to get into more detail on them. They’re present in both books, though
they’re mixed into the general “Elf” entry on the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>“Eladrin” is one of those names that used to refer to something else entirely in
previous editions. In this case, the name belonged to a set of Chaotic Good
Outsiders from Arcadia, only some of whom resemble elves. Now it belonges to a
playable race that has its roots in the Feywild.</p>

<p>While no D&amp;D player expects elves to be Santa’s little helpers, there are
several competing visions of what a “proper” elf should be. Woodsy archers who
wear earth-toned cloaks and shoot bows really well, like Legolas? Ethereal fey
wizards who live in resplendent silver cities, like Galadriel? Several of the
game’s settings in previous editions made attempts to accommodate both concepts,
and Eladrin are part of 4e’s own effort.</p>

<p>In short: Legolas is an elf, Galadriel is an eladrin.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As we saw with drow, back in the dawn of time there was only a single
“proto-elven” fey people, created by Corellon the god of magic and beauty. They
lived in the Feywild, where they built fantastic empires powered by arcane
magic.</p>

<p>Over time this ancient people underwent something of a diaspora, with part of
them migrating to the world and adapting to its local conditions, becoming the
elves we know today. Some of <em>those</em> would in turn convert to the worship of
Lolth and get driven into the Underdark, becoming the drow.</p>

<p>Those who stayed in the Feywild are known today as the Eladrin. Are they still
the same ancestral fey of legend, or have they undergone changes of their own?
Only your GM can tell.</p>

<p>Eladrin and elves still look somewhat similar, but still have some obvious
visual differences that make distinguishing the two easier. The most striking of
those are the eyes, which are solid orbs of blue, green or violet. Eladrin hair
also tends to be a brilliant white, or a metallic color like silver or
gold. Their skin can be of any tone found in humans, but the lighter tones are
more common. Less obviously, eladrin also tend to be a bit taller than elves,
and they’re longer-lived.</p>

<p>Most eladrin live in those fabulous Feywild cities, which are usually built in
places that touch the world with some frequency. Thus they’re a common enough
sight in the world to justify their inclusion as a playable character option.</p>

<p>Your typical eladrin citizen has a somewhat detached view of the world,
particularly since their cities weren’t affected by any of the bad stuff that
took down Nerath. Still, that typical citizen is still pretty relatable all
things considered.</p>

<p>The higher-up an eladrin is in their society, the more magically powerful and
weird they tend to be. Eladrin nobles are fully involved with the Fey Courts,
taking titles relating to the seasons or other abstract concepts. The most
powerful among them are quite likely to have become true fae and be the sort of
entity who makes pacts with warlocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual and Monster Vault give us four eladrin stat blocks each. Two
of them (the Fey Knight and Twilight Incanter) appear in both books. The ones in
the Monster Vault are clustered around the late-Heroic tier, but the ones in the
MM start there and go all the way to epic. All the MM ones have an alignment of
“Any”, while the MV ones are listed as unaligned. In either case this means they
can be either enemies or allies depending on the specific individuals that
appear in your stories.</p>

<p>All eladrin are Medium Fey Humanoids, and their most famous signature trait is
Fey Step, an encounter power which allows them to teleport 5 squares as a move
action. They also have low-light vision, and a +5 bonus to saves against charm
effects.</p>

<h3 id="eladrin-bow-mage">Eladrin Bow Mage</h3>

<p>The bow mage is Level 7 Minion Artillery. It has Speed 6, is trained in
Perception and carries a magic bow that fires Force Arrows: Ranged 20 vs. AC, a
hit does force damage and pushes 1 square. These wouldn’t be stealthy
tree-climbing snipers, but rather battlefield archers that fire in
formation. You’ll want to have then in a <em>loose</em> formation, though, to avoid
those area-effect attacks.</p>

<h3 id="eladrin-fey-knight">Eladrin Fey Knight</h3>

<p>This one exists in both books. It’s a Level 7 Soldier with 77 HP. It wears mail,
and wields a light shield and a longsword.  The MV version is clearly the best
of the two, so let’s start with that.</p>

<p>The fey knight cuts a striking presence in the battlefield, projecting a Feywild
Tactics aura in a 5-square radius that allows allies in range to score criticals
on a roll of 19-20 rather than just on a natural 20. There are very few
abilities in 4e that mess with critical range - IIRC this is the first one I’ve
seen on this Let’s Read.</p>

<p>Beyond the basic longsword attack, the fey knight can also attack with a Stab of
The Wild: Recharge 5-6, Melee 1 vs. AC, a hit does more damage than the basic
attack and restrains the target for a turn with what I assume are entangling
vines. As a minor action it can issue a Feywild Challenge to mark a target
within a Close Burst 5. It’s kinda like a paladin mark, lasting until the end of
the encounter or until the knight uses the challenge again, and dealing a bit of
radiant damage to the target when it doesn’t attack the eladrin on its turn.</p>

<p>The fey knight can also protect its allies with Harvest’s Sorrow, an immediate
interrupt that allows it to take half the damage of an attack directed at an
ally within 5 squares. It of course also has Fey Step.</p>

<p>The MM version is similar but a bit clunkier aside from the damage bug. Stab of
The Wild works the same but the knight can’t use its sword while a target is
entangled. Feywild Challenge has a range of 10 but is an encounter power. Use
the MV version if possible.</p>

<p>These are knights, so you can probably give them some sort of gallant fey steed
if you need to. They’re the ones fighting at the front and protecting that unit
of bow mages, and also make up the core of a noble’s guard detail.</p>

<h3 id="eladrin-twilight-incanter">Eladrin Twilight Incanter</h3>

<p>This wizard is a Level 8 Controller with 82 HP, present in both books. It wields
a spear in combat, and its strikes slow the target for a turn in addition to
doing damage. Since the incanter is a Controller, its spear attack actually has
decent accuracy and damage!</p>

<p>The incanter is also dangerous at range, with a suite of spells. Binding Bolt
(Ranged 5 vs. Reflex) does force damage and immobilizes for a turn. On a miss,
it instead slows for a turn. Teleporting Bolt (Ranged 5 vs. Reflex) does force
damage and teleports the target 3 squares on a hit. On a miss it still teleports
the target 1 square. Its final spell is Dazzling Blast (recharge 5-6, close
blast 3 vs. Will), which does radiant damage and blinds for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>The MM version has Range 10 on the bolt spells, and specifies that Teleporting
Bolt can’t teleport someone to an unsafe square. That’s just no fun, so I see
why it’s gone from the MV version. I suppose the teleport victim can still roll
a save to throw itself at an adjacent safe square at the last minute, as
standard for forced movement.</p>

<h3 id="eladrin-battle-dancer">Eladrin Battle Dancer</h3>

<p>This is a MV-only Level 9 Skirmisher. It has speed 6 despite wearing mail, and
fights with a longsword. The basic sword attack, named Dancing Blade, causes the
battle dancer to become invisible to the target for a turn! It also has a Battle
Dance encounter power that allows it to shift its speed and perform a basic
attack against any enemies it passes adjacent to.</p>

<p>It seems the Battle Dancer has also put some extra practice into its
teleportation, for it replaces the usual Fey Step with a <em>Surprise</em> Fey
Step. The range is the same, but it recharges on a 3-6 and grants the dancer
combat advantage against every enemy it appears next to.</p>

<h3 id="bralani-of-autumn-winds">Bralani of Autumn Winds</h3>

<p>The MM sends us right into the late Paragon tier! A bralani used to be a type of
outsider in 3.x, but now it’s apparently a rank in the fey courts. This
wind-themed noble is a Level 19 Controller with 180 HP. It has Resist 20 Radiant
and is vulnerable to necrotic damage, which slows it for a turn. The bralani is
surrounded by the Cloak of Autumn Winds, an aura 5 that makes its enclosing
volume difficult terrain for enemies - even if they’re flying.</p>

<p>Its basic longsword attack does nothing special aside from the damage, but once
per encounter the bralani can curse someone with Autumn Chill (Ranged 5
vs. Will), which weakens the target until the end of the encounter! It can also
use an at-will Whirlwind Blast (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude). On a hit this does
thunder damage and pushes targets 2 squares (3 on a critical). On a miss it
still does half damage.</p>

<h3 id="ghaele-of-winter">Ghaele of Winter</h3>

<p>A bit higher up in the totel pole is the <strong>Ghaele of Winter</strong>, Level 21
Artillery with 134 HP. It has 25 cold and radiant resistance, and the same
necrotic vulnerability described for the bralani. This ghaele is, well, an
Elsa. Its basic attack is Winter’s Touch, which does cold damage. It can cast
Freezing Rays (Ranged 12 vs. Reflex) that do cold damage and slow (save ends).</p>

<p>It can create bursts of Chilling Defiance (Close Burst 3) at will, which hit
automatically, do a flat 10 cold damage and slow for a turn. For each target
that takes damage from this, the ghaele regains 2 HP. It can also command
someone to let it go with its Imperious Wrath (minor action, Close Burst 3
vs. Will), which dazes targets <em>until the end of the encounter</em>. This recharges
whenever the ghaele regains 4 HP or more from a single casting of Chilling
Defiance. Fey Step rounds out its abilities.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is an artillery monster you do <em>not</em> want to go near.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There is one sample encounter here, but thematically, it’s a doozy: Level 21, 1
ghaele of winter and 4 wild hunt hounds. Yup, the Wild Hunt exists in this
setting, and it’s run by and for the less friendly sort of epic-level eladrin.</p>

<p>As far as attempted solutions to Elf Overload go, I like eladrin a lot. Their
name doesn’t include the word “elf” anywhere, making it a bit easier to remember
which is which. They’re an entirely different race mechanically, which is a
better solution than others I’ve seen that ended up loading up a single “elf”
race with bonuses related to both concepts. They’re also really atmospheric on
their own, of course, and allow players to portray genuine fae folk from level 1
if they so choose.</p>

<p>I hadn’t heard of eidolons before Fourth Edition, but I seem to recall the word
was used in 3.x too. They are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Eidolons are intelligent constructs created through divine magic. The ritual for
their creation involves a crystalized spark of divinity which is buried deep
into the eidolon’s structure. While the one from the illustration is a somewhat
abstract humanoid, I imagine they’re frequently built in the shape of the
deities their creators worship.</p>

<p>Eidolons are considered more than simple tools - they also serve as a symbol of
their creator’s devotion. Sometimes, though, that spark of divinity inside the
eidolon goes bad, which causes the creature to suffer from delusions of godhood
and to act with murderous intent towards anyone who disagrees.</p>

<p>If all of this sounds familiar it’s because it’s somewhat similar to the lore
for D&amp;D clay golems - constructs created by divine magic who sometimes go
berserk and turn on their creators. The main difference here would be one of
purpose. While clay golems are traditionally mindless solitary guardians,
eidolons are built to support and inspire their correligionists, and so are
always found among the faithful. It also helps that clay golems are absent from
this book.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Eidolons are Large Natural Animates with the Construct keyword, and Level 13
Controllers (Leaders) with 132 HP. They project an aura of fearlessness out to 5
squares, rendering any allies within immune to fear. As constructs, they are
themselves immune to fear, disease, and sleep. They walk with speed 5.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a slam, but it’s not the main thing Eidolons do. They’re
all about divine pyrotechnics. When one of their allies is slain in the
eidolons’s line of sight, they lash out with Vengeful Flames as a reaction. This
is a Ranged 10 attack that targets Reflex and does both immediate and ongoing
fire damage. It does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>As a standard action the eidolon can assume a Hallowed Stance, which I guess
makes it look like a normal idol statue. While in this state it gains resist 20
to all damage, and any allies in its line of sight gain +1d8 damage to all their
attacks. The stance lasts for a turn and ends immediately when the eidolon
moves. That last bit is just another way to say it can keep Hallowed Stance up
indefinitely as long as it remains perfectly immobile and does nothing else.</p>

<p>If anything attacks the eidolon while it’s maintaning Hallowed Stance, it smites
the offender as a reaction with Divine Retribution which has Range 20, targets
Reflex and does radiant damage (half on a miss). Like Vengeful Flames, it does
not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>There are two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 eidolon and 4 githzerai cenobites. I guess it’s a statue of
Zerthimon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 eidolon, 2 grimlock berserkers and 1 medusa warrior. I got nothing
on this one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Surprisingly atmospheric! Despite the similar lore, eidolons play very
differently from clay golems. Golems are agressive bruisers; eidolons want to
remain completely still during the fight and let their reaction and passive
powers do the work. It’s quite possible for the party to not realize they’re
dealing with an eidolon until the Vengeful Flames begin to kick in when the
other monsters drop.</p>

<p>Efreets are drawn from Middle Eastern mythology and Islamic tradition, which say
they’re a type of djinn often depicted as evil and associated with
death. They’ve been in D&amp;D at least since the days of First Edition as the
official fire genies (other elements have their own genies as well). They’re
present both on the Monster Manual and on the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like in most editions, the Efreets in Fourth are fire genies, and are usually
evil antagonists. They come from the Elemental Chaos, where their civilization
is one of the most ordered things in that chaotic plane.</p>

<p>Efreets are giant-sized humanoids with powerful builds, red skin, and curved
horns, part flesh and part smokeless fire. They claim they are the firstborn of
the Primordials and as such are the rightful heirs to their domains and
creations. That doesn’t mean they <em>worship</em> the Primordials - Efreets don’t
really worship anyone but themselves and intensely dislike being placed in any
position that even resembles servitude.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as an “efreet commoner”. Every single one of them is a
noble with their own title, holdings and multitudes of servants and
slaves. Though the number of existing efreets is on the small side, they project
an incredible amount of power from their citadels spun from fire and metal. The
greatest such settlement is the City of Brass, an oasis of stability in the
Elemental Chaos that has stood unchanging since the dawn of time. From there,
the Lord of All Efreets rules their civilization.</p>

<p>Efreet houses constantly scheme against each other, and when one of them wins
such a dispute they usually take a member of the losing house as a servant and
hostage - a fate Efreets consider worse than death. Though they despise
servitude, they’re still smart enough to bargain with mortals when doing so
brings them some advantage. That’s where the “genies grant wishes” myth comes
from!</p>

<p>You see, Efreets don’t actually have the ability to grant reality-bending
wishes. They are however fantastically rich potentates with access to large
multiversal organizations and epic-level magic, which makes the distinction moot
for most mortals.</p>

<p>These elemental nobles also like to organize hunting expeditions to other
planes, going after big game such as dragons or other equivalent creatures just
for the fun of it. It’s like a British fox hunt on a grand scale, particularly
when you remember that fox hunters basically acted like raiding hooligans who
wantonly trespassed on people’s properties, trampled their livestock, and
threatened complainers with violence in the name of a jolly good bit of sport.</p>

<p>I find the official illustration above to be somewhat innacurate. These efreets
should be wearing fantastic fireproof finery instead of these drab loincloths
and plain mail.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most Efreets are early-Epic threats, with some of them going upwards to
late-Epic. They’re Large Elemental Humanoids (fire), and they signature traits
are a complete immunity to fire and a Blazing Soul aura 1 increases the ongoing
fire damage taken by any enemy within. They can also fly and hover. The MM
versions have no particular vulnerability to cold, but the MV versions are
slowed for a turn when they take cold damage (a trait called Frozen Fire).</p>

<p>Efreets are all highly intelligent and speak Primordial as their primary
language. They’re also trained in all the skills you’d expect a society of
magically-potent nobles to know.</p>

<p>Let’s look at them in the order they appear on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h3 id="efreet-fireblade">Efreet Fireblade</h3>

<p>This Level 22 Soldier has 206 HP. Present in both books, the MV version has a
Blazing Soul aura that increases ongoing fire damage by 5, and Frozen Fire. The
MM version lacks both of these traits but is still immune to fire. It runs with
speed 6 and flies with speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>In both versions the Fireblade wields a scimitar. Its Reach 2 attacks mark the
target for a turn on a hit. It can also throw the scimitar, Jedi-like, as a
Ranged 10 attack that can target 2 creatures within 5 squares of each other
before returning to the efreet’s hand, marking each of them for a turn on a
hit. This recharges on a 4-6.</p>

<p>Finally the Fireblade can execute a Whirling Fireblade Strike that recharges on
a 5-6, and targets all enemies on a Close Burst 2. It does scimitar damage plus
10 ongoing fire damage to anyone it hits (save ends).</p>

<p>This monster wants to start its fights by keeping at range and hurling the
scimitar, but it can deal with people in melee just fine.</p>

<h3 id="efreet-cinderlord">Efreet Cinderlord</h3>

<p>The Cinderlord is Level 23 Artillery with 169 HP. It has all standard efreet
traits in both versions. Visually the Cinderlord isn’t much different than the
Fireblade: a lavislhy-dressed efreet noble with a scimitar. Its powers, however,
are quite different.</p>

<p>That scimitar attack is weak for its level even on the MV, but it does ongoing
fire damage. Its main ranged attack is a Fire Bolt (range 10 on the MM, 20 on
the MV) that does fire damage and ongoing fire damage. It can follow that up
with Fan the Flames, a ranged 20 attack that targets someone taking ongoing fire
damage. It does a bit of automatic fire damage to the target, and triggers a
Close Burst 1 attack centered on the target that target the Reflex of any nearby
bystanders and deals fire damage to those it hits.</p>

<p>Finally there’s the Curse of the Efreet, an encounter power that recharges when
the Cinderlord is first bloodied. It’s a Ranged attack 10 that somehow targets
AC. On a hit it does both immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends), and
strips the target’s fire resistance completely until the end of the encounter
(no save!). This targetting AC is an interesting detail. Do the cinderlord’s
words of malediction take physical form and stab at you?</p>

<p>Curse of the Efreet makes the cinderlord an excellent addition to any party of
all-fire monsters.</p>

<h3 id="efreet-flamestrider">Efreet Flamestrider</h3>

<p>This Level 23 Skirmisher has 217 HP and all standard efreet traits. The MM
version uses a scimitar and the MV version a quarterstaff, but they have similar
abilities.</p>

<p>The basic melee attack does physical damage and ongoing fire damage (save
ends). It can also use Firery Grasp, a ranged attack that causes a fiery hand to
appear and hold the target in place. This targets Reflex, and does both
immediate and ongoing fire damage in addition to immobilizing the target (save
ends both). The MV version has Range 5, while the MM one has Range 20! This is
an at-will power, so I think the MV version is more appropriate for a
skirmisher.</p>

<p>The Flamestrider takes its name from its ability to vanish in a puff of smoke
and teleport up to 20 squares to appear next to another fire creature. It can do
this at-will.</p>

<h3 id="efreet-pyresinger">Efreet Pyresinger</h3>

<p>We’re climbing up the ranks of efreet nobility here! This MM-only monster is a
Level 25 Controller with 233 HP. It has all the standard efreet traits, with its
aura increasing ongoing fire damage by 10 instead of 5.</p>

<p>It attacks with a scimitar that also does ongoing fire damage, and Range 10 Fire
Bolts that target reflex and do the same. Its Fiery Chains are basically a more
powerful version of the Flamestrider’s Fiery Grasp, with Range 10 and the
ability to restrain instead of just immobilizing. As a move action, the
pyresinger can then slide the restrained target 1 square. This attack recharges
on a 4-6.</p>

<p>The pyresinger’s last power is Sheets of Flame, which sings a pyre into being in
an Area 3 within 20 squares. The 20-foot tall sheets of flame block line of
sight and cause 10 fire damage to anyone who enters or starts their turn in the
area. No duration is given, which I think means they last the whole fight. The
power recharges on a 4-6, which means there’s a good chance multiply such pyres
will litter the battlefield.</p>

<p>As an immediate interrupt, the pyresinger can interpose a Fiery Shield between
itself and a ranged attack, taking only half damage from it. The “immediate
interrupt” bit means this only happens once per round.</p>

<p>The pyresinger pairs very well with the flamestrider or other similar
enemies that can ignore the Sheets of Flame and keep moving through them.</p>

<h3 id="efreet-karadjin">Efreet Karadjin</h3>

<p>This big shot is a Level 28 Soldier with 260 HP, present only in the MM. It
lacks the Blazing Soul aura, an oversight that can be easily corrected. It’s
also not vulnerable to cold.</p>

<p>The karadjin fights with a Scimitar of Horrendous Flame, which does both
physical and fire damage alongside a heap of ongoing fire damage and
immobilization (save ends both). There’s also an ongoing fire damage
<em>aftereffect</em>, which means it takes one save to end the immobilization and two
to end the damage. All saves against both effects are at -2. This is the
karadjin’s basic attack! Yikes!</p>

<p>As a reaction, the karadjin can perform the above attack against someone who
just hit it with a melee attack. And as a minor action, it can order an
elemental ally it can see within 10 squares to shift.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual has no less than four encounters involving efreets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 fireblades, 1 flamestrider, and 1 glabrezu. Yes, efreets are
exactly the kind of epic spellcaster that would summon and bind high-end
demons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 23: 1 cinderlord, 3 blood fiends, 1 fire titan. Just make blood fiends
demons already! Fire titans might be among the only elemental creatures
efreets might respect. A tiny bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25: 1 pyresinger, 1 great flameskull, 1 marilith, and 2 fire titans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 27: 1 efreet karadjin, 1 pyresinger, 1 glabrezu, 2 dragonborn champions,
2 great flameskulls. Wow, someone seriously pissed the Lord of All Efreets off
enough for him to send his personal hit squad.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, efreets can be found alongside almost any high-level elemental
creature, many of which they keep as slaves. Even before the PCs hit the epic
tier, they can find themselves facing the lower ranks of an efreet’s forces.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m sure these details on efreet culture were present in previous editions but
this was my first time being exposed to them. I quite like the whole.</p>

<p>I’m also sure someone already made jokes comparing them with devils too, since
they have red skin, horns, like fire, and are evil. However, it seems to me that
the evil of an efreet is not the cosmic evil of a devil. Rather, it’s the evil
of a fantastically wealthy person whose culture prevents them from developing
empathy with anyone from a lower social class.</p>

<p>Mostly you still have plenty of reason to punch them, but this opens the
possiblity that there are efreets out there who managed to turn out Good anyway,
possibly due to converting to worship of a good god. This is both an interesting
development and true to the original stories, which often features djinns of all
kinds who turned good because they converted to Islam.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Duergar don’t feature in the first Monster Manual, being MM2 monsters, but they
do feature in the Monster Vault, so we cover them here. Technically their entry
comes before the one for dwarves, but I’m posting them afterwards because basic
dwarves provide some important context.</p>

<p>Between the two books we have quite a lot of duergar stat blocks, so I’m making
an executive decision to only cover the ones that appear in the MV in this
post. The rest will be covered when I get to the MM2.</p>

<p>Duergar have been a part of D&amp;D since at least the 1st Edition days. Basically,
duergar are to dwarves what drow are to elves: the evil version that lives in
the Underdark.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When we looked at the Azer a while ago, we saw that not all dwarves managed to
free themselves from their giant masters. Duergar history also tells us that not
all dwarves who escaped found their freedom. Some of them Delved Too Deep (TM)
and were re-enslaved by mind flayers, who I’m sure made the giants look like
kind and caring masters.</p>

<p>It got so bad they came to believe Moradin had forsaken them, and started making
deals with devils in order to attain freedom from the flayers. The devils
delivered, and today’s duergar are the result of a centuries long mutually
beneficial arrangement between these former slaves and the forces of
Hell.</p>

<p>Duergar are about as nice as you would expect given their history. Their
civilization is authoritarian, militaristic, and built on the backs of
slaves. Isn’t it ironic? They still retain the dwarven knack for engineering and
metalsmithing, but their long association with devils has given them several
infernal mutations that somewhat resemble those undergone by tieflings in theme
if not in their exact mechanics. Most prominent are the graphite-toned skins and
the angry red poisonous quills sprouting from their beards and hair.</p>

<p>Duergar raid the surface from “shallow” outposts in search of loot and strong
slaves, but the true centers of their civilization are large fortified cities
deeper in the Underdark. Devils are a common sight in these cities, some of
which house embassies of Hell and/or have devils as prominent members of their
domestic power structures. Duergar leadership routinely consorts with devils, in
all meanings of the word.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The duergar stat blocks in the MV and MM2 go from mid-Heroic to late-Paragon
tier, with most of the later being in the MM2. Duergar are Medium Natural
Humanoids. The MM2 gives them the Devil keyword, but the MV doesn’t. In both
books, duergar have a few signature traits:</p>

<p>First, they have 5 resistance per tier to poison and fire; second, they can flex
their face/head muscles and launch those poisonous quills a short distance as an
minor-action encounter power. This is Ranged 3 vs. AC, and deals immediate
physical and ongoing poison damage along with a -2 penalty to attacks (save ends
both). Their usual speed is 5, like dwarves, and as Underdark dwellers they all
have darkvision too.</p>

<h3 id="duergar-scout">Duergar Scout</h3>

<p>An evil counterpart to the Dwarf Bolter or Warrior, this is a Level 4 Lurker
with 48 HP. It’s trained in Dungeoneering, Perception and Stealth, and has all
common duergar traits. It’s present in both books.</p>

<p>The scout is armed with a warhammer and crossbow, and has a Shadow Attack trait
that makes both deal extra damage when the target can’t see the duergar. That
can happen because of Underdark Sneak, which makes it invisible for a turn or
until it attacks. Like all duergar, it can also launch its quills.</p>

<p>In the MV version, Underdark Sneak is a standard action, meaning the scout uses
the lurker pattern of hide/big attack/rinse/repeat. The MM2 version has it as a
minor action, but makes it less magical by requiring that the scout be in dim
light or darkness and next to cover. Its Shadow Attack also does half the damage
of the MV version’s.</p>

<p>I would recommend always using the MV version. You want at least two scouts who
set up at opposite ends of the battle area and take turns sniping at the PCs
while their frontliners keep the adventurers tied down.</p>

<h3 id="duergar-guard">Duergar Guard</h3>

<p>These would be the afore-mentioned frontliners, counterparts to the Dwarf
Hammerer or Clan Guard. They are Level 4 Soldiers with 58 HP who wear mail and
wield warhammers two-handed. It’s present in both books.</p>

<p>The two versions are mostly alike, with the main difference being that the MV
version’s basic warhammer attack marks for a turn as an effect. As a minor
action they channel their Infernal Anger for a turn, adding 4 fire damage to
their attacks and gaining the ability to shift 1 square as a reaction to an
adjacent enemy moving. This recharges on a 5-6. There’s also the quills.</p>

<p>The MV version is preferrable both because of the basic math fixes and because
it can actually do its soldierly job.</p>

<h3 id="duergar-thug">Duergar Thug</h3>

<p>Basically a minion version of the Guard, present only in the MV. It’s a Level 4
Minion Brute with the same gear as the guard, and whose quills don’t inflict an
attack penalty but can still cause a bit of ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Feel free to throw hordes of these at a a party who triggers an alarm while
sneaking through a duergar fortress, and compare them with the Devil-Bred
Duergar at the end of the post.</p>

<h3 id="duergar-raid-leader">Duergar Raid Leader</h3>

<p>This Level 5 Artillery Leader has 51 HP and equipment similar to that of a
scout. In addition to attacking with its warhammer and crossbow, it can use a
Raid Leader’s Command to have an ally within 5 squares make a basic attack in
its place. And there’s also the quills.</p>

<p>The raid leader pairs well with the other duergars we saw so far, particularly
the guard with its marking basic attack. It also goes well with hard-hitting
brutes.</p>

<h3 id="duergar-infernal-consort">Duergar Infernal Consort</h3>

<p>We skip right to the big leagues here. The Infernal Consort is a Level 17
Controller with 164 HP and all common duergar traits. In case the title misleads
you, it’s worth clarifying that consorts can be of any gender.</p>

<p>The infernal consort fights with a warhammer, whose attacks push the target 3
squares and slow them for a turn on a hit. It also has a ranged basic attack
named Devil Possession (Ranged 3 vs. Will, recharge 5-6) that does exactly
that. Targets hit by it are dominated for a turn and cause 10 fire damage to any
ally that ends their turn next to them. At the start of the target’s next turn,
the consort can slide them 3 squares as a free action.</p>

<p>The consort can also perform an Infernal Summons (Area Burst 1 within 5
vs. Reflex) that brings a literal slice of Hell into the battlefield. This
at-will attack does sizable fire damage and creates a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts for a turn and does 10 fire damage to anyone who enters it or starts
their turn there.</p>

<p>The Infernal Consort is meant to be encountered amid a group of devils of
similar level, all of which have enough fire resistance to not worry about
its attacks. The consort’s own tactics would involve keeping at least one
Infernal Summons zone active at all times and using Devil Possession to drag
more people into it.</p>

<h3 id="devil-bred-duergar">Devil-Bred Duergar</h3>

<p>You’ve met the consort, now meet the kids! Technically, every duergar we saw so
far is “devil-bred” to some extent - that’s where the quills and such come
from. I guess they figured this was as good a name as any for the “high-level
minion” version of the Duergar Guard.</p>

<p>Devil-bred Duergar are Level 18 Minion Soldiers, wearing mail and wielding
warhammers. They use basic warhammer attacks to fight, and can also use it to
hit any adjacent enemy that makes an attack that doesn’t include them as a
target (Punishing Hammer; Melee 1 vs. AC). This does fire damage on a hit.</p>

<p>Strangely, this is the only duergar without a quill attack. For a non-minion
version you can level up the Duergar Guard and give it the Punishing Hammer
ability.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>In my experience, duergar never did have much success in the crowded “evil
underground civilization” space, being at best a third choice behind drow and
mind flayers. This version of them seems to have a more consistent flavor and a
level spread that means they’ll be the first things from the Underdark a PC
party is likely to encounter in their careers.</p>

<p>There are enough stat blocks here for you to assemble all-duergar encounters,
and you can also add imps or legion devils as reinforcements or other humanoids
as slaves. The late-Paragon entries are tailor made for pairing with devils.</p>
