            <p>(The book has an illustrated Secret of Vecna. I did not include the image here
because it’s gross.)</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>I first saw a stat block for these in Thunderspire Labyrinth, the second
heroic-tier module published for 4e. They appear here in revised form.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Vecna is an ascended lich, the evil god of secrets and magic. He teaches that
secret knowledge is the path to power, encouraging and rewarding his followers
to learn all they can by whatever means necessary. He also punishes his
followers for willingly <em>sharing</em> these secrets, an act that is anathema to
him. The most common punishment is to transform the heretic into a Secret of
Vecna.</p>

<p>These creatures resemble bald humans with plain features, usually wearing robes
and wielding daggers or staffs. When they get seriously wounded, their skin
sloughs off and they turn into an horrific living ghoul with wickedly sharp
fangs and claws. Secrets lack any will of their own, living to do the bidding of
their divine patron. They get sent to guard sites important to Vecna, or to aid
the plans of his priests. A Secret’s ultimate aim is always to advance Vecna’s
goals, though, even to the detriment of his followers. Smart followers know
never to trust a Secret completely.</p>

<p>Legend says there is a ritual capable of mending a Secret and turning them back
into the person they used to be. This could be done for altruistic reasons, or
as a means of getting access to the information that person knows.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Secrets are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6. They are <em>not</em> undead
and have no special resistances.</p>

<p>Their signature ability is <strong>Horrific Visage</strong>, which triggers as soon as
they’re bloodied. It works as a Close Burst 3 attack vs. Will. On a hit it does
light psychic damage and pushes the target 3 squares. This is the transformation
into a ghoul-like horror.</p>

<p>Some of the monster’s abilities can only be used before it transforms, while
others can only be used afterwards. So in practice each Secret has two distinct
attack profiles. The human one is usually some degree of tricksy, while the
“monster” one is simpler but stronger.</p>

<h3 id="enigma-of-vecna">Enigma of Vecna</h3>

<p>A spellcaster who grew too greedy and offered to sell or barter the secrets they
learned in service to Vecna. They retain some of their magic, and gain the
ability to temporarily strip a victim of its memories. They’re Level 6
Controllers with 68 HP.</p>

<p>When human, they fight with <strong>daggers</strong> and magic. <strong>Shock Bolt</strong> is a ranged
attack that targets Reflex and does lightning damage, also slowing the target
for a turn. And <strong>Memory Ripper</strong> is another ranged attack targetting Will and
doing light psychic damage with an awesome rider. Targets hit by this spell are
prevented from using encounter or daily attack powers, and any utility powers
(save ends).</p>

<p>After the Enigma is bloodied, <strong>Horrific Visage</strong> triggers and it transforms
into a straightforward melee combatant. Its only attack from that point on is
<strong>Rend Flesh</strong>, which does heavy physical damage.</p>

<h3 id="spell-howler-of-vecna">Spell Howler of Vecna</h3>

<p>This is a more powerful caster who failed Vecna in some way. Maybe they failed
on a mission given to them by the god, or failed to share a secret with Vecna
after discovering it. Or maybe they just dug too deep and looked into matters
forbidden to one of their rank. They’re Level 18 Artillery with 130 HP.</p>

<p>Spell Howlers are powerful enough to not need weapons. Their basic attack is a
<strong>Maddening Touch</strong> that deals psychic damage. Their basic ranged attack is a
<strong>Word of Force</strong> that targets Fortitude and does force damage. They can use a
<strong>Word of Madness</strong> to deal psychic damage, slide the target 3 squares and have
it make a free attack against another target of the howler’s choice. This
recharges on a miss, so they can keep trying it. And finally they can say a
<strong>Word of Pain</strong> once per encounter to deal heavy necrotic damage to a target,
half on a miss.</p>

<p>Most of this stops after the transformation. Maddening Touch remains an option,
but their only ranged attack is now the <strong>Word of Doom</strong>, which deals psychic
damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="secret-of-vecna">Secret of Vecna</h3>

<p>The titular monster of the entry used to be a high priest of Vecna who allowed
some of the god’s secrets to fall into the hands of a non-believer. Vecna
appears to them personally to shatter their minds and transform their bodies.</p>

<p>Secrets are Level 19 Skirmishers with 176 HP. Faster than average, they have a
Speed of 8 and a Teleport speed of 4.</p>

<p>In human form, they use a <strong>Cloak of Ignorance</strong> spell that covers a Close Burst
3, deals psychic damage, and makes them invisible to the target (save
ends). Then they move in with <strong>Shocking Grasp</strong>, a basic attack that deals
lightning damage and has a big damage bonus when the target can’t see the
monster.</p>

<p>After transforming, their only attack is <strong>Thundering Claws</strong>, which deals heavy
thunder damage, knocks prone, and slides 1 square.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This is exactly the sort of odd monster that you can typically find in Monster
Manuals numbered 3 or above. Fortunately they had enough space for a nicely
evocative bit of lore. Their mechanics are an interesting take on the
“two-stage” monster, and a different one from both the MM2’s Phoeras and Fey
Lingerers.</p>

<p>As the lore mentions, these are Vecna’s specialty divine servitors, so they’ll
be found wherever the god’s cultists and temples are.</p>

<p>The concept of scary animated scarecrows is a classic, so I’m sure they popped
up in earlier editions. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Scarecrows in the middle world are straw mannequins placed on fields to keep
birds away. Scarecrows in the Feywild are terrifying constructs built to keep
<em>people</em> away, and to tear them to pieces if they get too close. Both look the
same, so never forget which plane you’re in.</p>

<p>The first animated scarecrows were created by a hag with straw stolen from a
farmer at the stroke of midnight, clothes from a freshly slain corpse, and
thread made from the hair of a nightmare. The idea spread quickly, and now lots
of different people use them. I imagine the recipes used by less evil creators
are not as macabre, though the construction of a scarecrow still involves a lot
of work.</p>

<p>Scarecrows are a bit less sturdy than golems, but they’re much smarter. They can
understand more complex instructions and have a link to their master that allows
for long-distance, two-way communication. When a scarecrow spots an intruder, it
transmits what it sees to its master. They’re alarm and surveillance systems in
addition to being guardians.</p>

<p>If the master dies, any surviving scarecrows will keep following their last
orders. This means you could find an ancient ruin guarded by masterless
scarecrows in the Feywild.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Scarecrows are Medium Fey Animates (Constructs). They’re immune to disease,
poison and sleep, though non-minion variants are also vulnerable 10 to
fire. They have low-light vision and a speed of 6.</p>

<h3 id="scarecrow-shambler">Scarecrow Shambler</h3>

<p>A proper scarecrow takes months of careful work, with each stitch and each bit
of straw placed precisely in the configuration that will allow it to hold the
most magic reinforcement and power. A skilled enough ritual caster, however, can
cut a bunch of corners and and produce a small army of these crude models.</p>

<p>Shamblers are not much tougher than a mundane scarecrow, as their magic barely
holds them together. They are still strong enough to kill someone with their
bare hands, and are filled with toxic mold that spreads through the air when
they are destroyed.</p>

<p>These creatures are Level 10 Minion Brutes. Their basic attack is <strong>claw</strong> that
does physical damage with no special riders. When destroyed, they disintegrate
in a puff of moldy straw, creating a zone in a Close Burst 1 that lasts until
the end of the encounter. The zone is a poison cloud: it’s lightly obscured and
deals 10 poison damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>Clearly, shamblers are meant to die en masse and blanket the battlefield in a
giant poison cloud. An ignorant wizard might inadvertently help them along by
popping an entire group with an area attack. I guess they still act as cameras
for their master too.</p>

<h3 id="scarecrow-guardian">Scarecrow Guardian</h3>

<p>The “baseline” model discussed in the lore section, painstakingly crafted to act
as a guardian. They’re Level 13 Soldiers with 107 HP.</p>

<p>Guardians fight with their <strong>Claws</strong>, which damage and mark on a hit. They also
have a couple of gaze attacks: <strong>Luring Gaze</strong> (at-will) is a ranged attack that
deals psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares; and <strong>Horrid Gaze</strong>
(minor action, encounter) is a Close Blast 3 that deals no damage and
immobilizes for a turn. These are tailored to allow the monster to prevent
intruders from escaping.</p>

<p>They’re also deceptively hard to kill - the <strong>Malleable Straw</strong> interrupt kicks
in when they’re damaged, and causes them to take half damage from the
attack. Since it’s an interrupt, it only works once per round, but still makes
them more durable than their HP would indicate.</p>

<h3 id="scarecrow-haunter">Scarecrow Haunter</h3>

<p>Haunters are created by adding an extra ingredient to the original scarecrow
recipe: the heart of someone who was killed by another scarecrow. It gets sewn
into the construct’s body, from which it irradiates the fear its former owner
felt before dying. The haunter twists this raw emotion into frightening
illusions when hunting down intruders.</p>

<p>Haunters are Level 13 Lurkers with 99 HP. They fight with <strong>Claws</strong> and have
several interesting special attacks. The first one we must mention is the
<strong>Lurking Horror</strong> passive trait. It makes it so all of their attacks deal 5
extra damage and have their forced movement increased by 2 squares.</p>

<p>As lurkers, haunters can begin harrassing the party from a distance, while
safely hidden. <strong>Haunting Echoes</strong> an area burst 2 within 10 attack that targets
the Will of all enemies inside. A hit slides the target 2 squares and forces
them to make a basic attack against a creature of the haunter’s choice as they
try to fight the imaginary ghosts conjured within their minds. With Lurking
Horror, this slide could be as large as 4 squares.</p>

<p>Once spotted, they can use <strong>Terrifying Gaze</strong> (recharge 5+) as a minor action
to keep the PCs at bay. This is a Close Blast 3 that targets Will, deals light
psychic damage, and pushes 2 squares.</p>

<p>Their “hiding” ability is <strong>Fluttering Straw</strong>, which allows them to seemingly
burst into a cloud of rotten straw and rags while teleporting 6 squares and
becoming invisible and insubstantial for a turn. They’ll use it to avoid being
surrounded and to resume their stealthy “grenading” with Haunting Echoes.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Quite interesting! Animated scarecrows are always good for a bit of scary fun,
and these don’t disappoint. I like the contrast with golems: the creation of a
D&amp;D golem is described like a highly technical process that involves trapping
elemental spirits. The creation of a scarecrow is the telling of a scary fairy
tale, relying on the inherent narrative power of its ingredients.</p>

<p>Unless you choose to make less evil scarecrow recipes a thing in your setting,
they’re probably the domain of hags, lamias and other paragon-tier evil fey. A
particularly ancient hag is going to have a small army of Guardians and Haunters
protecting her territory, and the realization that each of these represents at
least one of her previous victims will add to the horror of the situation.</p>

<p>If you want your Heroic-tier players to meet scarecrows without having to trek
to the Feywild, I would suggest statting the Shambler as a Level 3 Regular, and
knocking the other two down to level 6 or so.</p>

<p>Rog grubs have been around more or less since the beginning, though they used to
be more of a trap than a monster in the past.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Rot grubs are voracious parasites with a life cycle so accelerated some scholars
think they’re a divine curse sent by Torog to inflict suffering upon the
world. They burrow into the bodies of larger creatures, eating their flesh and
laying eggs inside. They don’t care if the body in question is alive or dead,
either. A living being infested by a swarm of rot grubs will experience
indescribable agony as they’re eaten alive, and this lasts until the grubs reach
the heart and kill the host.</p>

<p>Rot grub infestations usually happen in underground dungeons, since they like
the dark and humidity. Sapient creatures that like the same environments quickly
learn to watch out for rot grubs, since an infestation can depopulate their
homes in short order. Some, like orcs, just pull up stakes and move elsewhere
when they find rot grubs. Others try to find uses for them. Kobolds stick them
inside clay pots for use as special sling ammunition. Bugbears use them to
enhance pit traps. Gnolls use them as instruments of torture.</p>

<p>These infestations tend to burn themselves out as the rot grubs eat through all
available victims in the area and then die from starvation. Only a few hardy
individuals remain, possibly in hibernation, waiting for the next unwary victim
to approach their corpse host.</p>

<p>There are, however legends of entire <em>oceans</em> of these horrible little things
undulating in the depths of the underdark. Supposedly, they sustain themselves
by feeding on the flesh of a dead god.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rot Grubs are Natural Beasts, and a swarm large enough to count as a monster is
Medium in size. These swarms have Speed 5 and Darkvision, so they’re far from
the stationary hazards of earlier editions. If a swarm notices you, it’s going
to pursue.</p>

<h3 id="rot-grub-swarm">Rot Grub Swarm</h3>

<p>The basic model. After killing their first few victims, they retreat inside the
bodies and lay up to ten thousand eggs. These hatch into new swarms after a
month or so. This is the classic “trap” scenario from earlier editions.</p>

<p>This swarm is a Level 4 Brute with 63 HP. It has the common traits mentioned
above, and the usual Swarm traits: half damage and no forced movement from
single-target attacks, vulnerable 10 to area attacks, can occupy the same space
as other creatures and squeeze into any space big enough for a single grub.</p>

<p>It’s also a <strong>Clumsy Attacker</strong>, which means it lacks a basic melee attack. It
still has an attack ability, but it’s not considered “basic”. This means the
swarm can’t charge or make opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Aura</strong> has a size of 1 and deals 5 damage to any enemy that stars
its turn inside. This damage increases by 2 for each extra swarm whose aura
overlaps the target.</p>

<p>The swarm attacks with <strong>Infesting Bites</strong>, which deal no immediate damage but
inflict ongoing 5 damage on a hit (save ends). This worsens to 10 after the
first failed save, and to 15 after the second. An unlucky level-appropriate
adventurer will find themselves dead from this about as fast as a PC from the
olden days. Save-boosting powers and items are a wise investment here.</p>

<h3 id="rot-grub-zombies">Rot Grub Zombies</h3>

<figure class="center">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even grub-infested corpses are a little more active than they used to be! This
is such a horrible death that it’s not uncommon for the victim to rise as a
zombie soon afterwards. These zombies are on the faster side, and some speculate
they’re controlled by the swarm inside them, since they are drawn to victims
with open wounds that make it easy for the grubs to leap into their bodies.</p>

<p>The zombie is a Level 8 Skirmisher with 86 HP and Speed 6. Its basic attack is a
<strong>slam</strong>, and it can also execute a <strong>flailing slam</strong> that allows it to shift 1
square before or after the attack. Their special attack is <strong>Rot Grub Hunger</strong>
(recharge 5+), which targets a bloodied enemy and deals slam damage plus 2d6
necrotic damage. Hit or miss, it also exposes the target to rot grub
infestation.</p>

<p>When the zombie hits 0 HP, <strong>Corpse Collapse</strong> kicks in and spawns a rot grub
swarm in its space.</p>

<p><strong>Rot Grub Infestation</strong> is a level 4 disease with an improve DC of 18 and a
Maintain DC of 12. This makes it a slower version of the infestation implied by
the basic swarm. Stage 1 eats a healing surge and makes the patient vulnerable 5
to necrotic damage. Stage 2 eats a second healing surge and inflicts a -4
penalty to all skill rolls. Stage 3 kills the victim and immediately turns them
into a rot grub zombie.</p>

<p>If you dislike the way D&amp;D 4 implements disease, you could replace the exposure
effect and bonus necrotic damage of Rot Grub Hunger with the increasing ongoing
damage from the basic swarm.</p>

<h3 id="awakened-rot-grub-swarm">Awakened Rot Grub Swarm</h3>

<p>Maybe this is a swarm that ate something very psionic, maybe it’s a duergar
bioweapon run amok… whatever its origins, this is a rot grub swarm that became
sapient. Its telepathic hive mind emits constant chatter with affirming phrases
such as “Without us, within them, reap their flesh”. Sometimes bits and pieces
of its victim’s minds also contribute to the noise.</p>

<p>The awakened swarm is mostly identical to the basic one, but it’s a Level 10
Brute with 123 HP. All the numbers go up, including aura damage and the ongoing
damage inflicted by their attack. They also get a couple of extra psychic
powers. <strong>Psychic Shock</strong> is a Close Burst 2 that deals no damage but
immobilizes for a turn on a hit. And <strong>Telepathic Lure</strong> is a ranged attack
(minor action, 1/round) that pulls a target 4 squares.</p>

<p>And of course this swarm is <em>sapient</em>, with Int 8, which is plenty to allow it
to set up ambushes or even make conscious alliances with other beings it can’t
eat.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ewwww. Early D&amp;D modules loved using rot grubs as a sort of lethal trap hidden
inside corpses found in the dungeon, usually those of previous adventurers. It
was not uncommon to also place some enticing loot on these corpses. They can
still be used in this role here, and while they’re not as instantly lethal as
their older versions, they’re still quite dangerous.</p>

<p>Ogrémoch is another of the Princes of Elemental Evil, and first appeared
alongside Imix in the Fiend Folio for AD&amp;D 1e. He is the second, but not the
last, epic campaign end boss to make an appearance on the MM3.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In the beginning there was substance without form, the roiling indistinct mass
of the purest Elemental Chaos. From that mass the eldest primordials arose
spontaneously, and they in turn used their powers to create others. Eventually
this big family decided to get together and create the middle world.</p>

<p>Ogrémoch is one of these eldest Primordials. He witnessed the dawn of time, and
the rise and fall of his children as they built the world and warred with the
gods. Ogrémoch was among the primordials contacted by the Elder Elemental Eye,
and like the other Princes he became convinced the Eye was the very first
primordial. Concerned about the gods’ growing influence on the world, he decided
to join the Dawn War in concert with the other Princes. Despite their atypical
level of teamwork, they lost.</p>

<p>Unlike Imix, Ogrémoch did not escape the gods. He was captured and chained to
his own realm by Moradin. Though he cannot leave, he can still influence the
world through his many cults. His goals are to free both himself and the Elder
Elemental Eye, and to finish what he started during the Dawn War.</p>

<p>His greater age and more stable element make Ogrémoch a more patient and wise
Primordial than Imix. Where Imix is a cowardly hothead, Ogrémoch is a cryptic
miser. As the Primordial of Earth, he rules over everything that is hidden
underground, from metal and gem deposits to caves, ruins, and the treasures
buried inside them. Ogrémoch knows many secrets that give one power over the
earth and its hidden bounty, but he’s jealous of them and only gives them up
reluctantly.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of time and patience for his cultists to earn enough favor to
learn those secrets, so earth magic is rarer among them than you would
expect. It’s no unusual for a cult leader to have to rely on hired muscle to
reinforce the security of their hidden shrines.</p>

<p>There are many independent cults to Ogrémoch spread throughout the world, and
though the details of their beliefs and practices may differ, they’re all
structured like mystery cults. They thrive on the rustic fringes of “civilized”
lands, tricking the innocent and ignorant into believing Ogrémoch is a
benevolent power of the earth. By the time these unfortunates learn the truth,
it’s too late to escape the cult’s grasp. More rarely, they attract more
well-informed people who seek an alternative to the gods. While there are
several deities who preside over the same concepts as the primordial, these
recruits probably reason that, as the older being, Ogrémoch has more of a claim
to these domains.</p>

<p>At the highest levels of initiation, the differences between the many cults fall
away, and the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye is revealed. These
high-ranking cultists serve Ogrémoch and the Eye in equal measure, and out of
all of the elemental cults they’re the most willing to genuinely cooperate in
freeing their masters</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We’ll start by looking at the cultists, and finish with the stats for Ogrémoch
himself.</p>

<p>The various cultist stat blocks represent people of various species that managed
to gain power from their worship. As with Imix cultists, there aren’t enough of
them to build encounter groups - they’re meant to be added to groups of other
humanoids or monsters representing hired muscle or “unpowered” cultists.</p>

<p>Any earth-elemental creature might be associated with a cult of Ogrémoch,
including hill and earth giants. Underground dwellers like grimlocks and
troglodytes are also frequently drawn to his service, as are “giantish” people
like ogres or ettins. And of course, any “generic” humanoid stat block can be
lightly reskinned as a cultist as well.</p>

<h3 id="earth-cultist">Earth Cultist</h3>

<p>These are common servitors, largely ignorant of the deeper mysteries, serving
because they know nothing else. They’re Level 8 Minion Controllers wearing
leather and wielding <strong>warhammers</strong>. The scrap of primordial power within then
explodes in a <strong>Petrifying Font</strong> when they drop to 0 HP: it automatically hits
every enemy adjacent to the cultist and slows them (save ends). After the first
failed save, this worsens to <em>petrified</em> (save ends).</p>

<p>Yikes! These poor souls are unwitting time bombs, and quite dangerous for
minions. Evil GMs would mix them in with standard <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/05/human.html">Human minions</a> and make it
hard for players to tell them apart at first. Once the cultist’s capabilities
have been identified, it’s best to take then out with ranged attacks.</p>

<h3 id="fist-of-the-stone-tyrant">Fist of the Stone Tyrant</h3>

<p>Every dwarf culture remembers their period of enslavement to the giants as the
Age of Chains. Most of them became resentful of the primordials after attaining
their freedom, and turned to worship of the gods. One felt the opposite, turning
away from the gods who did not help them and towards the primordials who had
proven they would reward their worshippers well. The Fist of the Stone Tyrant is
a champion from this culture.</p>

<p>This Fist is a Level 9 Soldier (Leader) with 98 HP and a Speed of 5 (Earth
Walk). They have two simultaneous auras with a radius of 1: <strong>Rotting Earth</strong>
slows enemies inside, and <strong>Stone Tyrant’s Boon</strong> grants allies inside a +2
bonus to AC and Fortitude. Like any other dwarf, the Fist reduces any forced
movement inflicted upon it by 1. It also gets an immediate save to avoid being
knocked prone.</p>

<p>The Fist’s <strong>war pick</strong> damages and marks for a turn on a hit, and if any marked
enemy leaves its Rotting Earth aura the champion can shift 1 square and make a
free attack against that enemy. The attack deals light physical damage, 5
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) and immobilizes for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="stone-thrall">Stone Thrall</h3>

<p>Ogres who live in hill giant territories might end up picking worship of
Ogrémoch from them. Some of these ogres get drawn into the cult and infused with
earth magic to act as guards and shock troops.</p>

<p>Stone Thralls are Level 15 Brutes with 184 HP. They fight with <strong>Mauls</strong> whose
basic attacks damage and force the target to grant combat advantage for a
turn. They can use a <strong>Crushing Smash</strong> against someone granting them CA to do
heavier damage, knock the target prone, and make them both immobilized and
unable to stand up (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also make <strong>Wild Swings</strong>, attacking up to 2 creatures with one
action. A hit deals heavy damage and dazes (save ends). This is an encounter
power that recharges when the ogre is first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="earth-weird">Earth Weird</h3>

<p>Ogrémoch rarely deigns to notice individual mortals. Sometimes, though, a
cultist comes along with such an aptitude for earth magic that the primordial
ends up giving them a direct blessing. This turns them into earth weirds.</p>

<p>The one depicted here is an earthsoul genasi, and a Level 16 Controller with 148
HP. It fights with a <strong>Morningstar</strong> that damages and pushes the target 1
square. It also uses a bunch of different earth-themed spells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quake Bolt</strong> is a basic ranged attack that damages and knocks prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bury</strong> targets a prone enemy and does no immediate damage, but it
immobilizes the target, prevents them from standing up and inflicts ongoing 10
damage (save ends all). After passing the save, the target is slowed for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stoneburst</strong> is a ranged area attack that damages and created a zone of
difficult terraint for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, <strong>Earthshock</strong> is a minor action encounter power that does no
damage but knocks every enemy touching a solid surface in a Close Burst 1
prone.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The weird wants to knock you down and bury you. It pairs well with other enemies
with knockdown abilities.</p>

<h3 id="chthonic-apostle">Chthonic Apostle</h3>

<p>Most giants who serve Ogrémoch do so more out of fear than true devotion. This
one is an exception, and has been rewarded for it.</p>

<p>The Apostle depicted here is a hill giant, and a Level 24 Soldier with 225
HP. It fights with a giant-sized, Reach 3 <strong>greatspear</strong> whose basic attacks
damage and mark for a turn on a hit. It can also use the spear to <strong>impale</strong> a
marked creature, which deals light physical damage to start with and slides the
creature to the apostle’s space as they slide down the length of the weapon. The
target is immobilized and takes 10 ongoing damage, automatically moving when the
apostle moves. The apostle can keep attacking with the spear, and every time
they do so the impaled victim takes another 10 damage and becomes dazed for a
turn. When they successfully save against this, they slide to a space adjacent
to the apostle as they free themselves.</p>

<p>When the apostle becomes bloodied, their <strong>Stone Curse</strong> begins to take
effect. Their speed drops from the standard giant 8 to a 4, and they rain Resist
10 to all damage. When the apostle drops to 0 HP, they permanently become a
stone statue, which counts as blocking terrain. If they have a victim impaled
when that happens, the victim becomes restrained instead of immobilized. A save
still frees them as above.</p>

<h3 id="chthonic-stoneshaper">Chthonic Stoneshaper</h3>

<p>Worship of Ogrémoch is almost as old as mortal life itself. There are profoundly
ancient shrines and temples to the primordial in the depths of the
Underdark. Those who undertake a prilgrimage to these sites and survive the
journey are rewarded with potent magic, and by having much of their troublesome
free will taken away.</p>

<p>The Stoneshaper depicted here is a human who has undergone this process. It’s
basically a powered-up Earth Weird, with more damaging spells. It’s Level 24
Artillery with 175 HP. They fight with <strong>Warhammers</strong>, and have several
spells. First there’s <strong>Stony Embrace</strong> (Ranged 10), a basic attack that
damages, restrains and inflicts 10 ongoing damage on a hit (save ends). Then
there’s <strong>Rending Earth</strong> (Ranged 20), which targets enemies restrained by Stony
Embrace, deals slightly more damage, and stuns then (save ends). Finally there’s
<strong>Unruly Earth</strong>, a close burst 2 that damages, pushes 3 squares, and knocks
prone on a hit. This only targets enemies, too, so it can be used safely in a
melee.</p>

<p>A “save ends” stun is extremely powerful, and though the targetting condition
for Rending Earth is fairly restrictive a focused and lucky stoneshaper might be
able to use it every other turn. When fighting an enemy group including a
stoneshaper, follow the old Shadowrun adage and geek the mage first. The
stoneshaper will make this hard because the ranges involved make it easy for the
stoneshaper to stay far away and play hit-and-run.</p>

<h3 id="ogrémoch">Ogrémoch</h3>

<p>After looking at the cultists, it’s time to look at the Big Rock
himself. Ogrémoch’s domain is a flat-topped mountain in the depths of the
Elemental Chaos. He’s bound there by chains forged by Moradin from the whipping
winds that used to scoured that mountain. Though Ogrémoch is unable to leave his
domain, his confinement does not prevent him from affecting the mortal world
indirectly, and empowering his cultists.</p>

<p>Unlike the cowardly Imix, Ogrémoch prefers to fight alone. His preferred
battlefields are vast rocky plains and enormous caverns where his powers can
easily shape the terrain. PCs will mostly likely fight him as a campaign end
boss, either in his own domain or in another similar battlefield after he
escapes his prison.</p>

<p>Ogrémoch is a Gargantuan Elemental Humanoid with the Earth and Primordial
keywords, and a Level 34 Solo Soldier with 1244 HP. He has a ground speed of 8
with Earth Walk, and can also burrow and climb at the same speed. His special
senses include Darkvision and Tremorsense 20, and he is immune to poison, sleep
and disease. He also has the best version of demon-style Variable Resistance,
with a value of 20 switchable 3 times per encounter.</p>

<p>The primordial has three passive traits that explain why he likes stony or
earthy battlefields. The first is <strong>Jagged Earth</strong> is an aura (5) that turns its
area into difficult terrain. The first time a creature enters this aura on their
turn, they must pass a DC 32 Athletics or Acrobatics check or take 20
damage. Creatures with Earth Walk ignore the aura.</p>

<p>The second trait is <strong>Earthbound</strong>, which allows Big O to ignore any forced
movement or knockdown effects as long as he’s standing on a solid surface. And
finally we have <strong>Earth Glide</strong>, allowing him to pass through earth and stone
as if he had phasing.</p>

<p>His attacks of course include a lot of punches and their shockwaves, but before
we get to that, let’s look at the parallel minigame he’s got going with his
minor actions. <strong>Encasing Shards</strong> (recharge 5+) is a Close Blast 5 that targets
the Fortitude of everyone caught inside. It does no immediate damage, but is one
of those very fun gradual petrification effects. On a hit the victims are
immobilized (save ends), and this worsens to stunned and finally to petrified as
they fail their saves. They can still roll saves to end the petrification, but
those have a -5 penalty. Once Ogrémoch is bloodied, he can detonate those stony
cocoons with <strong>Earthshatter</strong>. This ends the petrification and makes a Close
Burst 3 attack centered on and including the victim. It deals a good bit of
physical damage for a minor action.</p>

<p>Ogrémoch’s basic attack is a <strong>Slam</strong> that does a big chunk of damage and
automatically dazes all of the target’s adjacent targets for a
turn. <strong>Ogrémoch’s Fury</strong> allows the primordial to make two slam attacks with
the same action, or three if bloodied. If more than one of these hits the same
target, it pushes that target 10 squares and worsens the Encasing Shards
condition if they’re currently affected by it.</p>

<p><strong>Earth Smash</strong> is a Close Blast 5 attack that does about half the damage of a
direct slam hit, but causes targets to fall prone and become dazed (save
ends). It does half damage on a miss. And then there’s <strong>Tremendous Quake</strong>,
which is a Close Burst 10 and so is likely to affect every PC. It’s an attack
vs. Fortitude that does a amazing damage, slides 4 squares, knocks prone, dazes
and prevents the target from getting up (save ends for these last two). Even on
a miss it does half damage, slides 1 square and knocks prone.</p>

<p>And he still has triggered actions! <strong>Jagged Eruption</strong> is a Close Blast 3
attack that happens as a reaction to Ogrémoch getting hit with a melee
attack. <strong>Eternal Resilience</strong> is the similar to Lolth’s ability, allowing him
to immediately roll a save when hit by an effect a save can end. This means such
effects only have a 25% chance of happening at all.</p>

<p>In summary: good luck keeping your balance or even acting at all when fighting a
living earthquake that’s also trying to petrify you. This much action denial on
a single monster is usually a design no-no, but we’re talking about a solo
endgame boss here, so I feel it’s more than justified.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>The ogre situation in the Monster Manual 3 is the same as the giant situation:
they first appeared in the Monster Manual 1, and are about to get new and
improved versions of those entries in the Monster Vault. The MM3 contains more
“exotic” variants that will nicely complement the rewritten “basic” ones from
the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Classic ogres, such as the ones that will show up on the Monster Vault, are
comically stupid brutes. The ones contained in this entry break that stereotype
by being significantly smarter, and capable of sophisticated tactics on the
level of any other humanoid opposition. In other words, the Monster Vault will
Ogre Harder while the Monster Manual 3 will Ogre Smarter.</p>

<p>The extra brainpower of these ogres doesn’t necessarily make them <em>nice</em> - the
entries here are still all Chaotic Evil, they’re just smarter about it. Nothing
prevents you from Shreking it up and having ogres that are both smart and
non-evil at your table, of course.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>As usual, Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 8. Everything
else about them varies per stat block, though their abilities tend to be styled
as big smashy strikes.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-cave-hunter">Ogre Cave Hunter</h3>

<p>This one is <em>sneaky</em>. The Cave Hunter has learned to perform stealthy raids,
evade pursuers, and lure them to ambush spots disguised to look like the ogre’s
home cave.</p>

<p>Cave Hunters are Level 8 Lurkers with 70 HP. Like typical ogres, they wear hide
and fight with ogre-sized <strong>Clubs</strong> that have Reach 2. However they can use
these weapons in more creative ways beyond the usual basic attack.</p>

<p><strong>Smash and Swing</strong> does half the damage of a basic attack, but dazes for a turn
and allows the ogre to slide the target up to 5 squares on a hit. It’s excellent
for herding PCs together so other monsters can use area attacks, and for opening
them up for the truly damaging attacks from the cave hunter itself.</p>

<p>The first of these is <strong>Skull Bash</strong>, which requires a dazed target and does
roughly double the damage of a basic attack. The second is <strong>Victim Shield</strong>, an
interrupt that requires a dazed enemy within 2 squares and triggers when it’s
targeted by a melee or ranged attack. It gives the ogre +4 to defenses against
that attack, and if the attack misses the chosen victim takes its damage
instead. In that case the cave hunter can also slide the victim 4 squares to
another space within 2 squares of it.</p>

<p>Note that the hunter doesn’t need to have dazed the victims itself in order to
use these abilities, so if there are other monsters who can daze in the fight,
they’ll be able to use these abilities more often.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-ironclad">Ogre Ironclad</h3>

<p>Ogre Ironclads are smart enough to wear piecemeal metal armor instead of the
more usual raw hides, and to fight using tactics that resemble cavalry, with
closed ranks and powerful charges. Since their armor is still kind of
improvised, being looted from smaller victims, it tends to fall off if it takes
too many hits.</p>

<p>Ironclads are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They wield big <strong>Mauls</strong> whose basic
attacks mark for a turn on a hit. Their <strong>Ironclad Reaction</strong> gives them a free
attack against a marked enemy that ignores the mark, and this attack also pushes
the enemy 1 square and knocks them prone.</p>

<p>While the ironclad is bloodied they take a -2 penalty to AC, but their charges
allow them to make basic attacks against up to 2 targets instead of the usual
single attack.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-storm-shaman">Ogre Storm Shaman</h3>

<p>Storm Shamans are perhaps the only ogres in the books that have no negative
modifiers in any of their mental attributes. They worship the primal spirits
that symbolize the fury of the storm, and their magic can bring that fury down
on their enemies.</p>

<p>Storm Shamans are Level 11 Controllers with 114 HP. All of their attacks have a
storm magic theme. They can cast <strong>Thunder Blasts</strong> to deal thunder damage and
deafen (save ends), or <strong>Call Lightning</strong> to deal lightning damage and blind
(save ends). Their melee attack is a <strong>Thunder Staff</strong> that deals thunder damage
and can daze (save ends) if it hits a blinded or deafened enemy. Those ranged
spells are also area attacks, so there’s a big chance that they’ll leave
<em>someone</em> vulnerable to a daze from the staff. A second shaman in the encounter
will make them both even more annoying.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-dreadnought">Ogre Dreadnought</h3>

<p>Conceptually, this is pretty much an upgraded version of the Ogre Ironclad
above. Unlike the Ironclad, the Dreadnought actually uses custom-fitted gear,
wearing a full suit of plate and wielding a greatsword.</p>

<p>Dreadnoughts are Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP. Their <strong>greatsword</strong> has a
Threatening Reach 2, and its basic attack also immobilizes for a turn on a
hit. If the dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can use <strong>Dreadnought Resolve</strong>
(recharge 4+) as a reaction to immediately reroll it with a +2 bonus.</p>

<p>They’re almost Brutes, in other words, since they lack a marking power. Still,
Threatening Reach and immobilizing attacks make them effective at halting the
PCs’ advance, so the Soldier role still fits.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A pretty varied lineup, especially when combined with the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/08/13/ogre.html">Monster Vault
ogres</a>. It should easily allow you to build all-ogre encounters for use as
the inhabitants of a lair or as a special unit in some other villainous force.</p>
