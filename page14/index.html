<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’m seeing this monster, but it’s been around since the
1e Fiend Folio. Most iterations kept the same haircut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A long time ago, a certain city was ravaged by a plague. Many died from both the
disease itself and from the violence that erupted as starvation, terror and rage
gripped the citizens. When everything seemed to be lost, those that were still
alive heard a soothing voice in their ears. It said:</p>

<p>“Your gods have fled this place. The spirits of the world no longer walk with
you. Your mages’ spells have failed you. In your hour of need, I alone hear your
pleas.” This entity proposed a simple bargain. The people of this city would
swear fealty to it, and in exchange the plague would cause no more deaths and
they would enjoy limitless food forever more. Out of carelessness or
desperation, the people accepted.</p>

<p>Turns out the soothing voice belonged to Baalzebul, the archdevil ruler of the
seventh hell. And as in any devil’s bargain, he fulfilled his promises to the
letter. His new servants no longer died from the plague, but they still caught
it and suffered from the weeping sores and endless hunger that were its hallmark
symptoms. The only thing that could nourish them and quell this hunger was the
flesh of other sapient beings, which technically counts as a “limitless” source
of food if you tally the world’s population.</p>

<p>These wretched creatures soon left their original city and spread through the
world, to fulfill the will of their new master and to look for new food
sources. They became known as Meazels.</p>

<p>Meazels rarely work with other sapients, because they can’t resist their hunger
for long. They prefer to work with trained or magically controlled beasts, and
their spellcasters can also summon and bind elementals. Some groups of Meazels
leave Baalzebul’s service and pledge allegiance to others who promise to rid
them of their curse. Most of these end up being Baalzebul’s rival devils.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Meazels are Medium Natural Humanoids, usually former humans. They have a ground
speed of 6 and Darkvision. They’re immune to disease, but suffer from an
infernal curse that mimics the symptoms of that original plague. This manifests
as the <strong>Wretched Curse of Baalzebul</strong>, their signature ability. It’s an aura
(1) that inflicts the same symptoms on any enemy inside.</p>

<p>Afflicted enemies take a -2 penalty to all defenses and become vulnerable 5 to
all damage while inside the aura. They also inflict the same effects on any of
their allies who are adjacent to them but outside the aura. Auras from multiple
meazels don’t stack.</p>

<p>Their other abilities all come from training, and vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="meazel-bravo">Meazel Bravo</h3>

<p>These are rank-and-file frontline fighters. Their tactics are straightforward -
charge in and hit the enemy until it stops moving. Their curse aura makes them
extra-effective in close quarters, and they love narrow terrain that leaves
their enemies little room to maneuver.</p>

<p>Bravos are Level 11 Brutes with 136 HP. Their basic attack is a <strong>Morningstar</strong>.
They can also use a <strong>Gut Shot</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+), which does slightly
less damage but weakens the enemy for a turn.</p>

<p>Note that neither attack takes the aura into account in their damage formulas,
which means they hit even harder than standard Brute of their level. Anyone in
reach of either attack is also inside the aura!</p>

<h3 id="meazel-hunter">Meazel Hunter</h3>

<p>Hunters are archers that like to coat their arrows in their own cursed
blood. Their preferred tactic is to snipe at their targets from behind a wall of
bravos.</p>

<p>Hunters are Level 12 Artillery with 88 HP. They fight in melee with <strong>Spears</strong>
that benefit from their aura, but prefer to stay back and use their
<strong>Longbows</strong>. Their basic ranged attack damages and slows for a turn on a
hit. They can use a <strong>Distracting Shot</strong> instead, doing the same amount of
damage and forcing the target to grant combat advantage for a turn. Once per
encounter they can do the blood-dipping thing and fire a <strong>Plague-Tainted Shot</strong>
that does the same damage and inflicts 10 ongoing necrotic damage (save
ends). While this effect remains, any of the target’s allies that starts their
turn adjacent to them takes 10 necrotic damage as well.</p>

<p>The plague shot is an interesting way to disrupt PC formations, since anyone
adjacent to a stricken victim will have an incentive to move away.</p>

<h3 id="meazel-strangler">Meazel Strangler</h3>

<p>While bravos and hunters do the obvious battling, stranglers sneak around the
edges of the fight looking for isolated enemies they can drag away. They’re
Level 13 Controllers with 125 HP.</p>

<p>All of their attacks are Reach 1, so they all benefit from the aura. The basic
attack is a <strong>short sword</strong>, but the real star of the show is the
<strong>Garrote</strong>. Its intiial attack is weaker, but it grabs the target on a
hit. (Athletics DC 24 or Acrobatics DC 26 to escape). In subsequent rounds the
Strangler can spend a standard action to sustain the grab and deal a heavy chunk
of physical damage to the target.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Plage Touch</strong> that targets Fortitude, does
immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and blinds (save ends both). It’s a good
opener to make that wizard easier to strangle.</p>

<p>As a move action, the strangler can use <strong>Drag to the Feast</strong>, which allows it
to move its speed and pull the grabbed victim along without provoking
opportunity attacks from them. Other PCs can still make OAs against the meazel,
but any that miss damage the grabbed victim instead.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The history of the meazels is the story of a bunch of people who, when faced
with the spread of a dangerous disease, chose to abandon science and put their
faith in an instant cure sold by a charlatan. They suffered the consequences and
still decided to double down.</p>

<p>I will note that this entry was written way back in 2010. Any similarity between
meazels and anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, and chloroquine/ivermectin enthusiasts
is mere coincidence. Mechanically, they’re okay. The aura makes for some nice
synergies with their other abilities.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Lolth is likely to be among the very first Big Bads of D&amp;D. I think her first
officially published mention was in The Village of Hommlet, an adventure
published in 1979 featuring one of her priests as the final antagonist. Since
that adventure and the Temple of Elemental Evil that follows it were all based
on Gary Gygax’s original campaign, there’s a chance Lolth was was a thing for a
few years before that even though she doesn’t appear in the first Monster
Manual.</p>

<p>She would make a personal appearance in 1980’s Queen of the Demonweb Pits, where
she officially became the patron goddess of the drow and started getting a lot
more publicity. The drow and their goddess would get plenty of spotlight time in
that edition and all subsequent ones, for good and ill.</p>

<p>By the time we get to this entry in the MM3, we’ve already seen most
Lolth-associated monster make their appearances, populating the entire range
from heroic to epic tier. We also heard a lot about Lolth herself as a goddess
in other supplements. This is where we finally get her stats. She is the second
“epic end boss” to make an appearance in this book, but not the last.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Lolth is described by the DMG as the goddess of shadows, lies, and spiders. As
we saw in the various Drow entries, back in mythic times she led a major
uprising against the other elven gods. Her defeat in that civil war saw her and
her proto-elf fey followers banished from the Feywild. Her followers moved to
the Underdark, where over time they evolved into the drow. Lolth herself took up
residence in the Abyss, crafting a whole layer of it into her personal domain.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, some of the divine-oriented supplements hint that
Corellon wasn’t entirely innocent in all of this, and that the reason Lolth rose
up against him is that he committed a great injustice against her. It wouldn’t
be too far off the mark to say that she wasn’t evil back then, and that it was
either the trauma of this first betrayal or a few aeons of living in the Abyss
that made her so.</p>

<p>Regardless of her past history, the Lolth of <em>today</em> is certainly Chaotic
Evil. Her followers organize themselves into strict hierarchies whose goal is to
enable an endless cycle of bloody betrayal: the powerful are free to abuse the
weak, and the weak are encouraged to rise in power by murdering their rivals and
superiors. Lolth herself doesn’t much trust her followers as we’ve seen in past
entries: she created at least two monsters whose main purpose is to infiltrate
those hierarchies and keep an eye on their members.</p>

<p>So, in a way, you could say Lolth is the goddess of the cycle of abuse. She
inflicts on her followers the same suffering she went through long ago, and
encourages them to do the same to their subordinates.</p>

<p>Her dominion is the sixty-sixth layer of the Abyss, a place known as the
Demonweb. As the name implies it’s a gigantic web strung across a series of
titanic pillars. On its strands rest many relics stolen from other worlds,
ranging from standard magic items all the way up to entire ruined
cities. Beneath the Web is a black void, and at the bottom of this void are the
Demonweb Pits, Lolth’s true headquarters. Here is where she holds court.</p>

<p>The Pits contain a multitude of portals to other layers of the Abyss and to
other planes entirely, and they’re one of the reasons why Lolth’s machinations
have such a large reach.</p>

<h3 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h3>

<p>This entry contains stats not only for Lolth, but also for her Aspect and her
Exarch. We’ll describe them in order of level, like we’ve been doing for the
other big shots in this series.</p>

<p>There are no entries for Lolth’s cultists. Most of them are the drow described
in the other monster books, as well as the Abyssal Drow and the Chitine from
this one. Like the other big bads, Lolth can certainly have cultists from other
species as well, using “generic” stat blocks.</p>

<h3 id="aspect-of-lolth">Aspect of Lolth</h3>

<p>Aspects are fragments of a deity’s power and mind. They share the original
deity’s personality and goals, but their existence is independent. Though
they’re never as powerful as the original deity, they’re still epic-tier. These
used to be called “avatars” in previous editions.</p>

<p>Most gods send their aspects to aid their most favored mortal servants, usually
in response to a ritual requesting this aid. Lolth is an exception. Anyone who
would have the power to call an aspect of Lolth is sufficiently initiated into
her mysteries to know that this is a <em>very bad idea</em>. Instead, they spend their
effort making sure she never has cause to send one.</p>

<p>The reason for this is what Lolth sends her aspects as infiltrators whose goal
is to influence drow society in ways that align with her goals. The aspect’s
natural form is that of a giant demonic spider, but it can assume the form of a
drow. It’s usual MO is to kill and replace an authority figure, and use the
victim’s power and influence to fulfill its mission. When forced to fight, it
reverts to its true form and “generously” spends the lives of its underlings to
buy victory, or at least survival.</p>

<p>Aspects of Lolth are Level 25 Elite Lurkers with 368 HP. They’re Large Immortal
Magical Beasts in their natural forms, but shrink to Medium size when disguised
as drow. They have ground and Spider Climb speeds of 6, Darkvision, and
Blindsight 5. They have Resist 30 Poison.</p>

<p>When an aspect hits a creature granting <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> to it, that
creature is weakened and takes 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends both) in
addition to suffering all the standard effects of the attack.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>. It can also shoot <strong>Acid Webs</strong> (recharge 5+) in
a Clost Blast 5. This deals acid damage and slows (save ends). On the first
failed save, the target also begins taking 20 ongoing acid damage until they
pass a save.</p>

<p>They also have a nasty power named <strong>Worthy Sacrifice</strong>, an area burst attack
centered on a non-minion drow, spider, or demon ally. This causes the ally to
explode into gory webs, reducing it to 0 HP, and attacks the Reflex of every
enemy in the blast area. This attack doesn’t damage enemies, but immobilizes all
those it hits (save ends). It also creates a zone of webbed gore that lasts
until the end of the encounter and immobilizes any non-spider who ends their
move inside (save ends). This recharges when the Aspect is first bloodied.</p>

<p>As minor actions, the aspect can create a <strong>Cloud of Darkness</strong> that blinds and
blocks line of sight for anyone but itself; and <strong>Change Shape</strong> to appear as a
Medium drow. The Insight DC to pierce the disguise is 43, hard even for someone
who min-maxed their Insight.</p>

<p>If anyone moves adjacent to the aspect, it can use its <strong>Impaling Legs</strong> as an
interrupt. This is an attack that deals physical damage and grabs the
target. Grabbed targets take 10 ongoing poison damage until they escape.</p>

<p>Being immobilized doesn’t actually make you grant combat advantage, but being
blinded does. The Aspect should fight alongside allies who can flank the
immobilized PCs. Worthy Sacrifice should be reserved to use on an ally who’s
about to die anyway.</p>

<h3 id="eclavdra-exarch-of-lolth">Eclavdra, Exarch of Lolth</h3>

<p>Eclavdra has an interesting publication history. Turns out <em>she</em> is the actual
final boss of the GDQ series, the one who used to be behind the giant attacks
and everything. And she’s not even a Lolth worshipper there! Facing Lolth in
those modules is more of a weird detour than the actual thing that solves the
problem. A reference to this makes it into her description here.</p>

<p>Eclavdra is described by the book as the “quintessential drow”. Another way of
putting it might be that no one in the universe has a deeper understanding of
Lolth’s mysteries aside from the goddess herself. This means Eclavdra is both
Lolth’s greatest ally and her most dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>Eclavdra has tried to betray Lolth not once, but <em>twice</em>. The first time she
worked with the Elder Elemental Eye (that’s the GDQ adventures), and the second
she worked with Graz’zt. She still carries a relic of the Eye, the Tentacle Rod,
and uses it as her main weapon and implement.</p>

<p>Despite these previous betrayals, Eclavdra has not only remained in Lolth’s good
graces, but her standing seems to have <em>improved</em>. Maybe the Lady of Spiders
admires her audacity. When roleplaying Eclavdra, it would not be out of place to
take your cues from Vriska and Starscream.</p>

<p>Eclavdra is a drow, and thus a Medium Fey Humanoid. She’s also a Level 28 Elite
Soldier with the Leader keyword. She has the drow’s Speed 7 and Darkvision. She
has no special resistances, even to poison, because Lolth is not stupid.</p>

<p>As she is the <strong>Spider Queen’s Emissary</strong>, any demon, drow, and spider allies
within 5 squares of Eclavdra have a +2 bonus to attack and can shift 1 square as
a minor action. Her <strong>Tentacle Rod</strong> is stretchy and has Reach 3. It can be used
in a few special maneuvers in addition to giving her a basic attack.</p>

<p><strong>Tentacle Lash</strong> has the same reach and damage as a basic attack, but on a hit
it also strips all poison resistance or immunity from the target <em>for the rest
of the encounter</em>. The target is also slowed (save ends). This is an at-will
power!</p>

<p><strong>Insidious Offer</strong> is a ranged spell that deals very weak psychic damage for
its level… but on a hit it forces one of those interesting choices I like so
much. The target must choose between taking an extra 30 psychic damage from the
attack, or becoming dominated (save ends). That’s very in theme - it’s not
“real” betrayal if it’s not a choice.</p>

<p>Eclavdra’s minor-action attacks are an unfortunate throwback to the “sexy
dominatrix drow” days. <strong>Entrancing Beauty</strong> is a Close Burst 5 that targets all
enemies, deals light psychic damage, and pulls then 2 squares on a hit. <strong>On
Your Knees</strong> is a non-damaging attack with the tentacle rod that makes the
target fall prone and prevents them from standing up (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Blinking Escape</strong> allows Eclavdra to teleport 6 squares and gain
concealment as a reaction when she’s hit by a close or area attack.</p>

<p>Eclavdra is loathe to risk her own life. She will make use of guile and
manipulation to prevent hostilities from initiating, and when they do she will
use her underlings as shields. When the tide of battle turns against her, she
will attempt to run away.</p>

<h3 id="lolth-the-demon-queen-of-spiders">Lolth, The Demon Queen of Spiders</h3>

<p>There’s no need to repeat the lore of Lolth here - it’s all up at the start of
the article. Mechanically, she is notable for being the first official two-stage
boss I’ve seen. I believe she’s also the first actual god to get stats in this
edition, and the most powerful endgame boss so far.</p>

<p>This means she has two stat blocks! The first is her drow form, in which she is
a Level 35 Solo Lurker with 634 HP. When she hits 0 HP in this form, she becomes
a Huge demonic spider who is a Level 35 Solo Brute with another 634 HP.</p>

<p>In both forms Lolth has ground, climb, and teleport speeds of 8. She also has
Darkvision, Blindsight 20, and is immune to poison. Her remaining abilities are
entirely different in both forms.</p>

<p>In her <strong>drow form</strong>, Lolth fights with a <strong>Scourge</strong>, a multi-tailed whip. Its
attacks are Reach 3, do some light physical damage, and slide the target 3
squares. They also inflict ongoing 20 poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>She can use the <strong>Insidious Poison</strong> ability (recharge 4+) to automatically
force an enemy that’s taking ongoing poison damage to attack an ally. That
attack deals a lot of extra poison damage as well.</p>

<p>She has three minor-action attacks. <strong>Lolth’s Kiss</strong> is a Reach 1 melee attack
that deals a bit less damage than the scourge, but inflicts the same amount of
ongoing poison damage. <strong>Poison Strands</strong> is a ranged attack that deals no
immediate damage but immobilizes (save ends). After the first saved throw, this
worsens to Restrained. After the second the target begins taking <em>50 ongoing
poison damage</em> until they pass a save to end all of this at once. That’s the
deadliest poison in existence! And yeah, both of these are at will.</p>

<p>The third is an encounter power: <strong>Impenetrable Darkfire</strong> is a Close Burst 5
that targets enemies. It blinds, inflicts 20 ongoing fire damage, and makes
it impossible for them to benefit from cover or concealment (save ends all). It
also creates a zone that lasts for a turn, blocks line of sight for everyone
but Lolth, and blinds anyone inside who is not Lolth.</p>

<p>When an enemy hits Lolth, she can use a <strong>Dominating Rebuke</strong> as a reaction to
<em>automatically</em> dominate them for a turn. And as a deity, her <strong>Immortal
Resilience</strong> allows her to immediately roll a save when she is inflicted by any
effect a save can end. This is a “No Action” effect, meaning it <em>always
happens</em>, giving her a 75% chance of ignoring all save ends effects outright.</p>

<p>The transformation that happens when Drow Lolth hits 0 HP is also an attack. It
targets all enemies in a Close Burst 10. On a hit they become vulnerable 20 to
all damage, and are stunned (save ends both). As an aftereffect after passing
the save, they’re pushed their speed away from her and are dazed for a
turn. After this resolves, Lolth assumes her spider shape, and uses that stat
block going forward.</p>

<p><strong>Lolth the Spider Queen</strong> is, as mentioned, a Huge spider and a Level 35
Brute. Her basic attack is now a <strong>Bite</strong> that deals much stronger base damage
and still inflicts 20 ongoing poison damage. <strong>Insidious Poison</strong> is still here
and work the same, but the damage bonus is bigger.</p>

<p>As a minor action she can spray <strong>Burning Webs</strong> in a Close Burst 5 that deal acid
damage and immobilize (save ends). After failing the first saving throw, victims
are restrained instead and take 30 ongoing acid damage.</p>

<p><strong>Immortal Resilience</strong> is still here and works the same. She also has
<strong>Impaling Legs</strong> like those of her Aspect, but they’re Reach 3 and trigger when
an enemy moves into reach. A target hit by the attack is restrained and begins
taking ongoing 20 poison damage (save ends both).</p>

<p>Finally, when Spider Lolth is first bloodied, she uses <strong>Divine Discorporation</strong>
to escape. This works automatically, and causes her mind to leave her body and
be unable to assume physical shape for a while. This period can last several
years, and while Lolth’s power will be greatly diminished during this time she’s
still alive and can direct her forces. A bit like Sauron in Lord of the Rings.</p>

<p>To truly kill Lolth, the PCs must fulfill a condition or complete a quest that’s
specific to her. If this happens, then she’s prevented from discorporating and
can be fought until truly killed. The book presents three example quests, and
the GM is encouraged to come up with something that fits their specific world
and campaign.</p>

<p>The example quests are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Loom of Fate</strong>, an artifact hidden deep within Corellon’s palace in
Arvandor. It was once used by Lolth, and it can be used by the PCs to
rearrange the threads of her fate and make her defeatable. Corellon knows this
but fears to use it. What doesn’t he want you to know?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Egg of Lolth</strong>, a mysterious artifact that can be destroyed to seal the
gates going out of the Demonweb Pits and thus prevent Lolth’s escape. But
then how do you get out?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lolth’s Prison</strong>, a demiplane beyond even the Demonweb Pits, where a dread
Bone Colossus guards the Pendant of Truth. Brandishing the Pendant before the
goddess of lies prevents her from discorporating. How will you get there, and
what truths will you find within?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>All of these enemies are quite interesting mechanically. I particularly like
Lolth’s two-stage-boss design. Her drow form is all about the insidious
poisoning of mind and body. Her attacks deal little immediate damage, and the
riders are what kills you. The spider form is a lot more direct.</p>

<p>As a Level 35 monster, a max-level party is going to have some trouble hitting
Lolth and avoiding her strikes. This fortunately doesn’t affect saves, but even
so the PC’s leaders should have plenty of save-granting abilities and items on
hand, because failing those saves has dreadful consequences. Conversely, offense
should focus on abilities that deal direct non-poison damage and whose riders
are either immediate or last a turn, because she’s almost immune to anything
that requires a save.</p>

<p>I also love Eclavdra’s description as a Starscream figure. That even works as a
proper elven surname if you want it to be really on the nose.</p>

<p>Kuo-toa made their 4e debut in the Monster Manual, and would get a MV style
upgrade in Dungeon 193. This entry gives us extra stat blocks that don’t overlap
with either, even though it came out months before the Dungeon update.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kuo-Toa basic lore remains the same. They’re the spear-wielding fish people that
live in the Underdark and worship aboleths and other aberrant entities. Their
priests, known as whips, are their absolute rulers, and discipline is enforced
by individuals known as monitors.</p>

<p>This entry adds that whips and monitors are able to force their underlings to
follow a coherent combat strategy even though those underlings tend to be very
mentally unstable. If these leaders fall before their underlings, the group’s
tactics will become a lot more erratic. Some will run, some will go berserk, and
so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>All kuo-toa in this entry have ground and swim speeds of 6. They are Aquatic and
have Darkvision. Their signature ability is Slick Maneuver, a move action that
can be used when they’re adjacent to an enemy and allows them to shift 3
squares, though they must end the move still adjacent to the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-mad-one">Kuo-Toa Mad One</h3>

<p>As you can guess from the name, Mad Ones are unstable even by the standards of
other kuo-toa. They’re afflicted by a form of supernatural insanity that
originates in the Far Realm and is contagious. They hang around old ruins and
temples, worshipping and guarding ancient artifacts far away from the rest of
their society. If one of these is stolen, they’ll give chase to punish the
thieves and recover the relic.</p>

<p>Mad Ones are Level 12 Minion Skirmishers, and notably lack Slick
Maneuver. Instead, they have an aura (1) of <strong>Spreading Madness</strong> that gives all
enemies inside 5 Vulnerability to psychic damage. Their <strong>Claw</strong> attacks damage
and allow them to shift 1 square on a hit. They can also release a <strong>Psychic
Scream</strong> in a Close Blast 3. It deals a small amount of psychic damage, though
that gets a boost from Spreading Madness.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-drowner">Kuo-Toa Drowner</h3>

<p>Drowners specialize on raiding ships and dragging their crews to a watery
doom. They wield hooks and barbed nets in combat.</p>

<p>Drowners are Level 14 Soldiers with 137 HP. Their <strong>hooks</strong> can be used for
basic attacks and for a <strong>Dredging Hook</strong> maneuver that does the same damage as
a basic attack and slides the target 3 squares to another square adjacent to the
kuo-toa. Combined with Slick Maneuver, this makes the process of dragging a
victim overboard into a sort of spiral dance.</p>

<p>The <strong>Barbed Net</strong> can be thrown as a ranged attack vs. Reflex. It deals a bit
less damage than the hook, and if the target willingly moves in their next turn
they take extra damage. Drowners carry 4 of these nets each.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-lash">Kuo-Toa Lash</h3>

<p>Lashes are a caste of lesser priests, subservient to the whips and responsible
for overseeing sacrifices. This includes leading raids to acquire victims. They
fight with tridents and a combination of lightning and water-based magic.</p>

<p>Lashes are Level 15 Artillery with 115 HP. They can use their <strong>tridents</strong> in
melee or throw them in a <strong>Lightning Trident</strong> attack that’s stronger, deals
lightning damage, and causes the weapon to return to the lash. Its main
disadvantage is that the range on this attack is only 3/6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Fill Lungs</strong> spell reaches a lot farther. It targets Fortitude, does
physical damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage. It’s also very scary.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Forked Lightning</strong> spell that works as a lightning-based
fireball that also blinds on a hit. This recharges whey they’re first bloodied,
or when they reduce an enemy to 0 HP.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-cutter">Kuo-Toa Cutter</h3>

<p>Cutters are classic skirmishers, trained to slip through enemy frontlines and
stab their squishies with serrated daggers. They’re Level 16 Skirmishers with
151 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>barbed dagger</strong> does standard damage for their level, and they can also
use it in a <strong>Crippling Strike</strong> that does less damage but inflicts slowness and
ongoing 10 damage (save ends). If someone misses them with a melee attack, the
cutter can shift 4 squares and use Barbed Dagger as a reaction.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These go well with the Dungeon 193 updated kuo-toa, and if you’re already using
those then you’ll like these ones. No big lore changes here, but the stat blocks
are cool enough.</p>

<p>Krakens have been in the game since AD&amp;D, but here they get some extra lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>At the beginning of time, long before the creation of the first mortals, the
Krakens escaped from the Far Realm and entered the middle world and the Astral
Sea, trailing the debris of other broken worlds behind them.</p>

<p>They had a good time for a while, but then a great cataclysm (perhaps the Dawn
War) scattered them. In our narrative present most of the surviving krakens are
hidden in the deepest trenches of the middle world’s oceans, or slumbering in
forgotten corners of the Astral. Every once in a while, though, one of them will
leave these dark holes and once again wreak havoc.</p>

<p>These creatures are extremely intelligent, though their mentalities are very
alien to mortals. They’re hostile to mortal sapients for incomprehensible
reasons, and are drawn to wherever large groups of sapient minds can be
found. When they emerge, groups of cultists soon gather around them, composed
both of mortal worshippers and aberrant creatures. Krakens are more than smart
enough to command and use these cults to help fulfill their destructive goals.</p>

<p>So yeah, Krakens are Great Old Ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We have two varieties of kraken here. One is more geared towards the classic
“giant squid attacks ship” scenario, and the other leans more on the Great Old
One aesthetic. Both are Gargantuan Aberrant Magical Beasts.</p>

<h3 id="sea-kraken">Sea Kraken</h3>

<p>A kraken that lives in the seas of the middle world. It is said that terrible
storms follow in their wake. They love to attack ships, and any vessel grabbed
by a Sea Kraken is likely doomed unless it happens to be transporting a party of
particularly badass adventurers.</p>

<p>Sea Krakens are Level 10 Solo Soldiers with 432 HP, which makes them a bit
lower-level than I anticipated given their general lore. They have darkvision, a
ground speed of 6, and a swim speed of 10. I think this makes them faster in
water than most ships.</p>

<p>Sea Krakens are obviously <strong>Aquatic</strong>, which means they can breathe underwater
and gain a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic creatures fighting them in the
water. They also have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> 3. As you might guess, this is a
grabby monster. Escaping its grabs requires a DC 26 Athletics or DC 22 Acrobatis
check.</p>

<p>The kraken’s basic attack involves its <strong>Crushing Tentacles</strong>, which are
Reach 3. They damage and grab on a hit, and the kraken can have up to 8
creatures grabbed by this attack. The monster can spend a minor action to
sustain all of its grabs and deal an automatic 5 damage to all victims.</p>

<p><strong>Devourer of Ships</strong> is a literal anti-vehicle attack - it can only target
vehicles, and it’s what the beast uses to coil around a ship. It deals heavy
damage to the target ship and restrains it while the kraken remains within 3
squares of it. While restrained, the ship takes 20 damage at the start of the
target’s turn. Its pilot can spend a Standard action to give the ship a saving
throw, and if it passes it escapes the grab.</p>

<p>And don’t worry, krakens don’t have to split their attention between a ship and
its crew. <strong>Coils of Doom</strong> is an at-will power that allows them to use Crushing
Tentacles twice and Devourer of Ships once with a single action.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also use an ability named <strong>Wavewrack</strong> to create a
zone in a Close Burst 3 around themselves. This zone is difficult terrain. When
an enemy starts their turn inside, they take 5 damage and are slid 2
squares. The Kraken can spend a minor action to slide this zone up to 3
squares. Do note that a Close Burst 3 around a Gargantuan creature is <em>much</em>
larger than one around a Medium creature.</p>

<p>Aside from moving the zone, the kraken can spend minor actions to activate any
of the following abilities. <strong>Fatal Plunge</strong> is an attack against a grabbed
creature that deals light damage and slides the target 3 squares. As the name
implies, this can allow the kraken to drag them <em>underwater</em>. It can also
<strong>Fling</strong> a grabbed creature, sliding them adjacent to another creature and
making a lightly-damaging attack against both. This ends the grab. And finally,
it can shoot <strong>Venom Bolts</strong> that deal poison damage and blind (save ends).</p>

<p>We’re not done yet! If a grabbed creature damages the kraken, the monster can
use <strong>Vengeful Constriction</strong> as a reaction to deal 5 automatic damage to every
creature it’s grabbing.</p>

<h3 id="astral-kraken">Astral Kraken</h3>

<p>Astral Krakens are “sea monsters” in the same way the Astral is a “sea”. Their
bodies are made of stars and shadow, their eyes two black lightless
voids. Madness precedes them and follows in their wake. You might say they’re
closer to their original forms than the sea kraken, as they never had to
acclimate to the middle world. You know how some people worship Aboleths as
god-like beings older than time? I bet Aboleths worship astral krakens in the
same way.</p>

<p>Astral Krakens are Level 25 Solo Controllers with 925 HP, putting them in the
same “weight class” as godforged and primordial colossi, divine and demonic
exarchs, and most ancient dragons. It takes the sea kraken chassis and adds
madness-themed abilities on top. It has a flight speed of 10, and
Blindsight 20. Invisibility won’t save you.</p>

<p>The kraken’s melee attacks have Threatening Reach 4. Its <strong>Tentacles From
Beyond</strong> work like the sea kraken’s, damaging and grabbing. The escape DC is 41
for Athletics, and 37 for Acrobatics. Sustaining the grab deals 15 psychic
damage to all victims.</p>

<p><strong>Absorb Psyche</strong> targets all grabbed victims at once, attacking Will and
dealing psychic damage. A hit also grants the Kraken a +5 bonus to attack with
Touch of Madness (below) <em>for the rest of the encounter</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Touch of Madness</strong> targets a single creature’s Will. It does no damage, but it
forces the target to use its highest-level encounter power against another
target of the Kraken’s choice. This happens even if the power was already
expended, and doesn’t expend the power if it hasn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Devourer of Ships</strong> is here too, and works much like the Sea Kraken
version. Despite its higher accuracy, it deals exactly the same damage. I guess
this makes sense, since a ship’s HP varies less than a PC’s as level goes up.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the astral kraken can release a <strong>Nullifying Pulse</strong> in a
Close Blast 4. This non-damaging attack targets Will and dazes (save ends) on a
hit. There are no other minor action attacks, but it doesn’t <em>need</em> any more
with such a powerful multi-daze at its disposal.</p>

<p>Its triggered actions are pretty scary too! When someone misses the kraken,
they’re forced to <strong>Behold the Horror</strong>. This is a reaction attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and dominates for a turn. Luckily it can only happen
at most once per round, since it’s a reaction.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the kraken is first bloodied, it lets out a <strong>Psychic
Scream</strong>, which covers a large enough area (Close Burst 10!) that it’s likely
to target every enemy. This attacks Will, and on a hit it deals psychic damage
and stuns (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>When it’s time to release the kraken, these two will not disappoint.</p>

<p>Sea krakens have a lot of straightforward multi-attack capability, and they’re
really hard to shake from your ship once they grab on. If the ship manages to
escape, they don’t have to divert their attention from the crew to grab the
vessel again.</p>

<p>The astral kraken’s multi-attack capability is less straightforward than the sea
kraken’s, but it has excellent action denial, and can be terrifying if you give
it time to set things up properly.</p>

<p>Both monsters don’t seem to have much defense against being dazed or stunned
other than the standard +5 solo bonus to saves, so doing that is a good way to
neutralize their firepower. If your party is heavy on the action denial powers,
you can make things harder for them by adding a sprinkling of cultist minions
and a leader-type that can grant them extra saves.</p>

<p>I believe jackalweres are another monster from the AD&amp;D days, but this time
around they get a new backstory.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The middle world was a ver dangerous place back during the Dawn War. Its lands
were constantly ravaged by splash damage and near-misses from the cosmic
struggle between gods and primordials. It was not unusual for ancient mortals to
go to war with each other and with the wildlife to secure shelter and food.</p>

<p>One of these wars was between an ancient human people and a nation of primal
jackals - sapient magical beasts that looked like mundane animals. The jackals
lost badly and were almost driven to extinction. The few survivors howled their
rage and grief to the skies, and to their surprise something answered. The
primal spirit known as the Dark Sister hear their cries and gave them her gifts,
turning them into the first jackalweres. These gifts give jackalweres the
ability to assume human form. Not a single specific human form, like a
lycanthrope, but <em>any</em> human form, like a doppelganger.</p>

<p>Present-day jackalweres organize themselves into small nomadic packs. Some roam
and hunt like their distant ancestors did, staying mostly in their natural
animal form. Many of them, however, still carry those ancestors’ grudges against
humanity and treat them as prey. They use their shapechanging powers to spy on
human communities at the edge of the wilderness and to disable their defenses
before launching a devastating raid with the goal of killing everyone. And once
someone comes in to investigate the carnage it’s not uncommon for them to find a
party of “adventurers” doing the same. These adventurers are, of course, the
jackalweres who were responsible for the raid and who stuck around to kill the
responders.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jackalweres are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Shapechanger keyword. Their
signature ability is <strong>Change Shape</strong>, which allows them to take the form of a
Medium jackal or that of a human. Their clothing, armor, and possessions do not
change, which means they must either have stashes of gear to don after taking
human form, or they must take someone’s place. They can disguise themselves as
any individual they’ve seen before, and the DC for seeing through this is 26 -
very high for their level.</p>

<p>Jackalweres have Speed 6, the same as a human.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-bravo">Jackalwere Bravo</h3>

<p>Bravos are the younger members of a pack. They’re eager to prove themselves in
battle, but their elders have them acting as servants and menial laborers most
of the time. When they’re given orders to fight, they do so with enthusiasm and
release all of their pent-up anger.</p>

<p>Bravos are Level 3 Brutes with 56 HP. The <strong>Bravo’s Fury</strong> trait gives them 1d6
bonus damage against dazed, helpless, or prone creatures. In human form, they
fight with <strong>Falchions</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons. In jackal form, they
<strong>bite</strong>, which does a bit less damage but knocks prone on a hit. Their
<strong>Howling Frenzy</strong> attack allows them to bite twice. If both bites hit the same
target, that target is dazed for a turn. This recharges once they’re first
bloodied.</p>

<p>When the PCs fight a pack of bravos, it’s interesting to mix up their
forms. They can knock PCs prone or daze them while in jackal form, and their
human-form buddies can benefit from this while using the stronger falchion
attack.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-harriers">Jackalwere Harriers</h3>

<p>Harriers are Level 3 Minion Soldiers with no patience for subtlety. Maybe
they’re even younger and more eager members of the pack, or maybe they’re
previously wounded warriors forced to fight. Whatever the case, they’ll try to
knock their enemies down so their stronger buddies can finish the job.</p>

<p>Harriers fight with <strong>daggers</strong> in human form and with <strong>bites</strong> in jackal
form. The bite is a normal minion attack, and the dagger does a bit less damage
and makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn. In either form, if the
harrier hits someone who’s granting combat advantage, they knock the target
prone.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-deceiver">Jackalwere Deceiver</h3>

<p>This is an experience pack leader that has developed some minor magical
powers. They often run some sort of operation that allows them to kill human
victims discreetly. Deceivers are Level 4 Controllers wtih 54 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>bites</strong> or <strong>short swords</strong> depending on their form, and as
usual the bite knocks prone. In jackal form they can also use a <strong>Vicious Howl</strong>
that attacks a Close Blast 3, does thunder damage, and knocks prone on a hit. In
either form they can use a <strong>Gaze of Sleep</strong> (recharge 5+) that does no damage
and causes the target to fall unconscious (save ends). If the unconscious target
takes damage, they get an additional save against the effect.</p>

<p>Deceivers usually lead a band of bravos and harriers, which means they have an
incentive to lean on Vicious Howl and Gaze of Sleep to allow their hench-jackals
to deal bonus damage against the PCs.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These monsters are not technically lycanthropes despite their shapechanging
ability, and this is something I only really got after reading their stat
blocks.</p>

<p>According to the book, the typical jackalwere pack consists of a mated pair of
deceivers leading a mixed band of bravos and harriers. If the pack is currently
in disguise, they’ll hire mercenaries to provide additional protection and
firepower. They prefer to hire half-orcs, goliaths and warforged for these jobs
since they dislike the flesh of these species. This implies they find everyone
else tasty.</p>
