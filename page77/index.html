          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/29/rick-and-morty.html">My Review of Rick and Morty</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This blog is supposed to be only about roleplaying games, but if I don’t get
this out my mood will forever be ruined. In any case, please note that this
article only represents my own opinion.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people rave about Rick and Morty for a while now, but until my brother
decided to show it to me I had never actually watched it, save for the first
minute or so of the pilot. The show’s fans, my brother included, always say it’s
very smart and funny. Based on those first thirty seconds, I had the suspicion
it would be “smart” and “funny” in the same way South Park and Family Guy were.</p>

<p>My brother showed me what he considers the most iconic episode of Rick and
Morty, the one with the nested artificial universes. And based on that episode
and on the others I watched that day I must say I was wrong. Rick and Morty is
not as bad as South Park and Family Guy. It’s <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>You see, when you watch this show you closely follow the antics of a sociopathic
buffoon with the power to destroy the world. You see every horrible thing he
does in lurid detail. And he always gets away with it, whatever “it” might be
this episode. This is in turns horrifying and depressing. It’s too much like
reading the news in real life. In short, it’s <em>not funny</em>.</p>

<p>But is it “smart”? Well, a lot of the show’s episodes use pretty nifty science
fiction ideas as a starting point, and have Rick twist them into some sort of
nightmare scenario. So yeah, this show is smart in the same way My Little Pony
porn is cute. Both make me die a little inside.</p>

<p>And yes, I watched the Pickle Rick fight scene. It’s very well animated and
coreographed, and its whole purpose seems to be making Rick look good. It’s
the Fox News of fight scenes.</p>

            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Holy Warrior, which means today’s character is Seelah
the Paladin. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seelah.jpg"/>

</figure>

<p>Cool, huh? She’s my second favorite design so far, losing only to Kyra (Lini is
a close third). Her <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Seelah">bio</a>, however, is by far the best. It’s quite tragic,
but seems to hit a good balance between “biblical” and “Arthurian”. Her official
stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seelah.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Seelah is a paladin of Iomedae the Inheritor, a Lawful Good deity of justice
and protection. She wears heavy armor and fights with sword and shield, with a
bow kept in reserve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has the usual varied suite of paladin powers, the ones most emphasized are
her fearlessness, her ability to smite evil, and her healing hands, in that
order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Seelah goes after all manner of evil foes, she fights fiends and evil
dragons with particular fervor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given Iomedae’s description as the goddess of justice and valor, the Holy
Warrior template fits her quite well. This Seelah has <em>almost</em> all of the
abilities of a standard D&amp;D Paladin. She lacks a “Lay on Hands” ability because
its DFRPG equivalent, Faith Healing, is quite expensive. However, she’s still
absolutely fearless, supernaturally resistant to disease, can channel divine
might to enhance her strength, and is particularly adept at fighting demons.</p>

<h2 id="what-changed-from-last-iteration">What Changed From Last Iteration</h2>

<p>Seelah was almost the opposite of Lini, in that pretty much nothing changed
point-wise between the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and DFRPG versions. All the skills
and abilities she has exist in the boxed set and work pretty much the same. The
skills of this version are slightly different, but that was a personal decision
rather than having to work around something that was missing from the books.</p>

<p>Her gear is the biggest change here, but even this was generally for the
better. While her armor has a bit less DR than in the first version, the overall
loadout is much lighter, leaving her at Medium Encumbrance instead of Heavy.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/10/pathfinder-dfrpg-druid.html">Lini the Druid in Dungeon Fantasy</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.</p>

<p>Today’s the template is the Druid, which means today’s subject is Lini. Here she
is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Lini.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Lini">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/lini.html">here</a>. From looking at these, we see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lini is a Golarion gnome, which is different from the Dungeon Fantasy gnome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is a druid and hails from the Land of the Linnorm Kings, home of the
Not-Vikings. She was always good with animals, and left the place shortly
after meeting her snow leopard animal companion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a sickle and a sling, but prefers to send her animal companion to
fight for her. Her magic is more or less even mix of terrain-affecting,
support and attack spells. She is also described as having a knack for
handling animals, particularly large mammals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lini is the first character that presents us with some real difficulties in
adaptation. Not because of her “exotic” race, since I’ve <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/05/fey-gnomes-dfrpg.html">statted that one up in
its own article</a>, but because the DFRPG boxed set doesn’t have rules for
animal companions! In fact, it doesn’t even have the Ally advantage, which
they’re based on.</p>

<p>This lines up with their goals of presenting a “streamlined” set of rules, since
Allies can bring a surprising amount of complexity to a game. They’re the only
NPCs whose points you have to keep track of, and you need to remember to give
them points in the correct ratio to keep them at the same percentage as the
PC. Still, their lack prevents us from being truly faithful to Lini’s Pathfinder
version.</p>

<p>This is what she ended up like:</p>

<h2 id="design-notes-and-what-changed">Design Notes and What Changed</h2>

<p>This version of Lini lacks her snow leopard animal companion, as there are no
rules for them in the boxed set. She has the Speak with Animals power instead.</p>

<p>If you have access to the full GURPS rules and to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 5:
Allies, then you can replace the Speak with Animals power with a 18-point
Panther natural ally, 1 point in the Beast-Speech spell, and another 4
elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you don’t, a rough approximation is to use the Lion from DF: Monsters. It
would cost 12 points to have that beast always be by your side, and it would
gain 1 character point to improve itself for every 2 points you gained. Buying
it would again involve replacing the Speak with Animals power and redistributing
the left-over points as above.</p>

<p>Aside from that, the other big change is once again her gear, which is costlier
and heavier. Though her weapons do a bit more damage, Lini is still better off
using spells or talking animals into fighting for her.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Until relatively recently, Gnomes were kinda like the Ugly Ducklings of the
small folk when it comes to games in the dungeon fantasy genre. In my
experience, Halflings have always been the tiny sneak-thieves<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and dwarves
the stocky, bearded axe murderers. Gnomes, on the other hand, just felt like a
somewhat bland blend of dwarven and halfling traits.</p>

<p>Over time, as authors began to cast about for a stronger niche for them, I began
to see a couple of different varieties. One of the most famous is the <em>tinker
gnome</em>, whose shtick is being good at messing with “advanced” technology like
clockwork mechanisms or steam engines. The Dragonlance setting takes this to an
extreme by making them pint-sized mad scientists, and the world of Warcraft
takes a similar tack. The gnome racial template present in both GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy and the DFRPG is a less extreme version of this type, having access to a
Talent that makes them good at dealing with locks, traps and making things like
crossbows.</p>

<p>The other famous gnomish niche is the <em>fey trickster</em>. Gnomes of this type
usually prefer the same type of forest that houses faeries and nymphs, can use a
bit of innate magic, and have other stats conductive to becoming good magic
users. Recent editions of D&amp;D usually go with this type of gnome in most
settings that aren’t Dragonlance, and Pathfinder follows suit.</p>

<p>If you want to play this type of gnome in your Dungeon Fantasy game, this racial
template will help you!</p>

<p><strong>Racial Cost</strong>: 0 points</p>

<p>Fey Gnomes are about as big as halflings, but no one would confuse the two. With
their slim builds, pointy ears, large eyes and wildly-colored hair they look
more like tiny psychedelic elves. Tough they are mortal, these gnomes still have
a strong connection to the faerie realm, which manifests in their natural talent
for magic and their predilection for whimsy and pranks.</p>

<p>In Golarion (Pathfinder’s setting), these gnomes were native to an otherworldly
faerie realm, and were kicked out of it in the distant past. They never quite
adapted to mortal life, and to this day have some trouble relating to other
peoples or settling down.</p>

<p>In other settings, most Fey Gnomes might still live in those realms, or visit
them regularly! Gnomish communities would be more common here, and would rely
heavily on illusion magic to protect themselves.</p>

<h4 id="gnome-magic">Gnome Magic<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h4>

<p>You may learn up to three <em>wizardly</em> or <em>druidic</em> spells without regard for
pre-requisites! You must specify which spells those are during character
creation, though you can wait to actually learn them later if you wish. You must
still pay points to learn the spells as normal. If your Magery is 1 or more, it
gives a bonus to these spells (even if they are druidic).</p>

<p>The spells don’t all have to be from the same “power source” - you can choose
one wizardly and two druidic spells, or any other combination. Your choice is
subject to GM approval. Popular spells for gnomes include Apportation, Sound,
Light, Beast Speech, Invisibility or other illusions.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Cleric, which means today’s star is Kyra. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Kyra.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Kyra’s character design is among my favorite from the Pathfinder iconics. You
can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Kyra">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/kyra.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is from Qadira, her world’s Persia/Arabia equivalent. She’s the sole
survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is a cleric of <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a>, the goddess of healing, redemption,
honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a scimitar, her deity’s favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
have a “light, fire and healing” theme, and she possesses the typical D&amp;D
cleric ability to turn undead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">original</a> version used the modified Sun Cleric template from GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics, but here we have no choice but to go with the basic
Cleric template from the DFRPG boxed set. That’s not a bad thing, however! It
turns out that the Cleric spell list has been tweaked to include a bit more
righteous burnination, so it ends up being quite close to that of the Sun Cleric.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Kyra spent 1 point in extra starting cash to afford the scimitar (which has the
same stats as a broadsword). Her mandatory “holy” disadvantage is the Vow, which
means she must always offer enemies a chance to surrender and repent, and only
fight those who refuse. This is about as inconvenient as the Pacifism (Cannot
Harm Innocents) disadvantage from the GURPS Basic Set, and so is worth the same.</p>

<p>She also has the Diplomacy and Riding (Horse) skills, which make sense for her
and are in the rules despite not being on the template.</p>

<h3 id="changes-from-the-first-iteration">Changes from the First Iteration</h3>

<p>The Psychic Guidance perk doesn’t exist in the boxed set, so it was replaced by
1 level of Resist Evil and she had to spend points on Innate Attack for her
Sunbolt spell. And while Kyra was indeed able to keep most of her spell list she
still had to trade Ignite Fire (which is not on the list) and Continual Sunlight
(which is not in the box at all) for Resist Cold and Glow, respectively.</p>

<p>Kyra’s armor loadout also changed significantly, since mail is much more
expensive when using the rules from the boxed set. She also lost the bow and
arrows, relying on Sunbolts for ranged attacks.</p>
