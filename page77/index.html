<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Ogres have been a part of D&amp;D since its beginnings, when they were the bridge
between the Humanoid and Giant power ladders. Here, they are present in both
books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ogres are big, dumb, strong, and mean. So much so that there’s probably the
picture of an ogre near all of these words in your typical Nerathian
dictionary. They famously can’t count to ten even with all their fingers in
front of them, and their greatest technological achievement is wearing the skin
of their last meal as a loincloth so they can appear in official D&amp;D
illustrations.</p>

<p>Ogres live alone or in small nomadic bands. In both cases they settle into a
region, eat all available food, and move on. They don’t build complicated
shelters, instead using natural ones like caves and such. Ogres will hunt and
forage if they have to, but they always prefer to raid caravans or villages if
those are nearby. In combat, they use improvised weapons that allow them to
employ their great strength, such as tree clubs and big rocks.</p>

<p>You might be thinking this sounds a bit similar to the description for hill
giants that we already covered, and you’d be right. The main differences between
them is that hill giants are bigger, smarter, less bestial-looking and more
technologically developed, in a neolithic vs. paleolithic way. Hill giants have
some agriculture and built villages/steadings of their own. It also feels like
it’s easier to parley with hill giants than with ogres.</p>

<p>Despite their strength, ogres are easily recruited into service by monsters who
are more powerful or more numerous than them. This usually happens through a
combination of intimidation and food bribes. Ogres can be found working as shock
troops for orc or gnoll bands, or as auxiliaries and menial labor for hags,
dragons, and giants. Some of these patrons provide their ogre lackeys with
combat training and improved weapons, making them more dangerous. Smarter ogres
willingly seek out the mercenary life, working for money and arranging that
improved gear and training by their own initiative.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The traditional role of ogres in older editions of D&amp;D is as the star of a
“not-quite-boss” fight. Something that’s really hard for beginning adventurers
to face, but which they can defeat once they gain some XP and their players
become a bit savvier. Maybe you put them near the stairs to the second dungeon
level, or guarding some prime loot in a corner of the goblin lair or kobold
warren. When fighting ogres became easy for a group, they knew they had made it
out of the junior leagues. With some thought given to encounter design, it’s
still possible to have ogres in these roles.</p>

<p>Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids. The Monster Vault also gives them the Giant
keyword, in which is surely a callback to early D&amp;D. They move at Speed 8, and
seem to not be very compatible with magic of any kind: all the ogre varieties in
both books fight exclusively with physical attacks.</p>

<p>There’s quite a few varieties. The MM clusters them around the late heroic and
early paragon tier, the MV widens that band a little. I’ll look at them roughly
on the order of level, but pairing equivalent monsters from both books where
appropriate. When an ogre has equivalent versions in both books, the Monster
Vault version is usually the better one, so it gets more attention.</p>

<p>All ogres presented here are Chaotic Evil and speak only Giant, though the MM
says they might know a few words of Common such as “mine!”, “hungry!” and
“kill!”.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mv">Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>Ogres are the quintessential brutes, and this is the quintessential ogre. A
Level 6 Brute with 90 HP and Int 4, it wields a Reach 2 <strong>greatclub</strong> in melee
and throws big <strong>rocks</strong> at up to range 10.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the ogre can perform a <strong>Grand Slam</strong>, which does double the
damage of a normal club attack and <del>yeets</del> pushes the target 2 squares on a
hit.</p>

<p>A pair of these might fulfill the classic ogre role of “not-quite-boss fight”
for a level 1 or 2 party. Their ranged attacks make them more dangerous than old
D&amp;D ogres, though, since the party can’t just snipe at them with impunity.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-savage-mm">Ogre Savage (MM)</h3>

<p>This is Monster Manual’s take on old D&amp;D ogre. This one is a Level 8 Brute with
111 HP and the same <strong>greatclub</strong> as its MV successor. However it has no ranged
attacks, and its special melee attack is an <strong>Angry Smash</strong> (recharge 6) that
allows it to make two attack rolls and take the best result.</p>

<p>Despite being 2 levels stronger than the Vault ogre, the vagaries of the early
math make this one have the same attack bonus and damage. The only difference in
their basic stats are the 21 extra HP and defenses 1 point higher. You can still
have that not-quite-boss fight using the Ogre Savage as written, only you might
want to use one of them backed up by a troupe of weaker minions. Their lack of
ranged attacks might mitigate their extra power depending on your party
composition.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-hunter-mv">Ogre Hunter (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is a little more sophisticated, though that’s not saying much since it
still has Int 4. It’s a Level 7 Skirmisher with 84 HP.</p>

<p>The ogre hunter uses a one-handed Reach 2 <strong>club</strong> as its main melee weapon, and
carries a brace of stone-tipped <strong>javelins</strong> for fighting at range (Ranged
20). It’s <strong>Hurling Charge</strong> technique (recharge 4-6) allows it to throw a
javelin and make a charge if that hits.</p>

<p>If surrounded, the hunter can <strong>Clear the Ground</strong> by stomping really hard
(Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; Minor Action), which pushes everyone it hits 2
squares. If anyone is hit by this attack, the ogre can move its speed. Who would
have thought the words “agile” and “highly mobile” would ever apply to an ogre?</p>

<h3 id="ogre-skirmisher-mm">Ogre Skirmisher (MM)</h3>

<p>Aside from being level 8 with 91 HP, this is pretty much the same monster as the
Ogre Hunter above. Its damage is lower due to the math bug, Hurling Charge is an
encounter power that always allows two attacks, and it lacks Clear the
Ground. It also has a <strong>Skirmish</strong> trait that gives it a damage bonus on any
turn where it moves more than 4 squares. I think it’s safe to say it has been
entirely superseded by the MV Hunter.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mercenary-mv">Ogre Mercenary (MV)</h3>

<p>One of those smarter ogres who works for gold. This one is a Level 8 Soldier
with 93 HP and an Int of 7. It fights in melee with a Reach 2 <strong>morningstar</strong>
that marks for a turn on a hit, and throws Range 10 <strong>handaxes</strong> to fight from
afar.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on a single target with the morningstar, the Mercenary can
use a <strong>Brutal Sweep</strong> to attack everyone in a Close Blast 2, dealing a bit less
damage but knocking prone on a hit. This is an at-will attack! Alternating both
attacks makes the mercenary quite good at keeping the party busy.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-warhulk-mm">Ogre Warhulk (MM)</h3>

<p>A level 11 Elite Brute with 286 HP, the Warhulk is otherwise equivalent to the
Mercenary above. Its <strong>flail</strong> basic attack knocks prone instead of marking, and
the Brutal Sweep equivalent is an encounter power that otherwise works the same.</p>

<p>This results in a lackluster elite, since it only has one attack per round. If
you need an elite ogre, use an upgraded version of the Mercenary above.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-juggernaut-mv">Ogre Juggernaut (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 10 Brute with 131 HP, representing a larger and stronger ogre
than the basic level 6 version. It’s still Large as far as the rules are
concerned, though.</p>

<p>Ogre juggernauts have the same attacks as their smaller cousins, a <strong>greatclub</strong>
and <strong>rocks</strong>, which do more damage due to their higher level. Their signature
move is the <strong>Juggernaut Push</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). If this
hits, the juggernaut knocks the target prone, pushes them 1 square, and shifts
to occupy the vacated square. They can then <em>keep</em> repeating the push-and-shift
loop until they have shifted their whole speed! They can stop early if that’s
not practical, but for every square they push the target beyond the first they
do 1d8 damage do it!</p>

<p>7d8 damage is in line with a level 10 “limited use attack”, but it looks extra
impressive because that’s a lot of dice <em>and</em> your PC just got kicked all over
the battlefield like a soccer ball.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-minions-mm">Ogre Minions (MM)</h3>

<p>When fighting an ogre becomes easy, you’ve left the junior leagues. When you
routinely face hordes of them, you’ve joined the major ones. Ogre minions come
in two varieties: level 11 Ogre Thugs and level 16 Ogre Bludgeoneers. Both use
their considerable bulk to pad out the forces of onis, hags, and other powerful
paragon-tier bosses. Aside from the level difference, they’re identical.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to make “Bludgeoneers” an official unit name for a bunch of ogre
minions. Like Mouseketeers, but with more violence.</p>

<h3 id="arena-trained-ogre-mv">Arena-Trained Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>If you take a typical ogre and train them for a few years at the blood-sport
arenas of the Black Eagle Barony, this is what you get.</p>

<p>These ogres are Level 14 Brutes with 173 HP and an Int score of 8. They wield
<strong>greataxes</strong> in combat, and aside from their beefy basic attack they can often
make <strong>Vorpal Sweeps</strong> (Close Burst 2; enemies only; recharge 6) that do a bit
less damage to each target and deal ongoing 10 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Simple, but effective. And while this isn’t stated in their stat blocks, those 4
extra points of Int mean this ogre is much more capable of understanding tactics
and effectively coordinating with its teammates.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters in the Monster Manual are rather typical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 ogre savage, 1 orc eye of Gruumsh, 8 orc warriors, 2 dire boars. An
ogre working as a heavy for an orc party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 1 ogre warhulk, 2 ogre savages, 2 ogre skirmishers. And this is a
typical “small ogre band”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ogres are one of those monsters which I have a hard time finding
sympathetic. They’re the embodiment of a particular type of crass cruelty and
they fill that role well, even better than hill giants IMO.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if your main cultural reference for ogres is Shrek then it’s
perfectly possible to make them more sympathetic along those lines. While I like
the default presentation I wouldn’t mind seeing them in that light either. Just
keep those Pathfinder ogres away from my game.</p>

<p>Mechanically the Monster Vault stat blocks are better and you should use them if
possible. If you can’t, updating the damage of the MM ogres and giving the
Warhulk a second attack (or making it a regular instead of an elite) should make
them workable enough. Ogre stat blocks can also be used to represent younger or
weaker hill giants, like they were in the classic Against the Giants adventures.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I think Nightwalkers have been in the game since 3e - at least, that’s when I
first saw them along with other “Night-something” high level undead. Here,
they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Shadowfell is the antechamber of the afterlife. Whenever someone dies, their
spirit spends a time here before the Raven Queen sends it to its final
destination. If an extremely strong-willed evil person dies, though, they might
be able to hold on and stay in the Shadowfell through sheer orneriness. These
eventually become Nightwalkers.</p>

<p>This origin is actually quite similar to those of Devourers, evil people who
also avoid being sent to the afterlife and make new undead bodies for
themselves. Could it be that the two are related? Maybe a Nightwalker is what
you get when a Devourer eats enough souls. Or maybe they’re simply the luckier
psychopaths who got to make themselves a body of solid shadow instead of having
to settle for corpse bits.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Nightwalkers have bodies made out of the stuff of the
Shadowfell. This gives them the ability to control the energies of that plane to
some extent, which manifests as a series of cold and necrotic powers in combat.
They’re also expert ritual casters. One of the rituals they know is the one that
makes bodaks, though power-hungry PC wizards will be disappointed to know it
only works on the Shadowfell when cast by a nightwalker on someone they
themselves killed.</p>

<p>Nightwalkers communicate through telepathy, and understand Common. They’re
highly intelligent and no doubt always have an evil scheme or two cooking, with
bodaks acting as their agents in these matters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nightwalkers are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They’re Level
20 Elite Brutes with 464 HP and a host of passive traits. Darkvision, immunity
to disease and poison, 20 resistance to cold and necrotic, and 20 vulnerability
to radiant. They walk at speed 8.</p>

<p>They also emit a 5-square aura of <strong>Void Chill</strong>, which does 5 cold and necrotic
damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>The nightwalker’s basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>slam</strong> that does some physical
damage plus bonus cold and necrotic damage. Once per round as a minor action
they can use a <strong>Void Gaze</strong> (close Blast 5 vs Will) which does a bit of
necrotic damage, pushes the targets 4 squares, and give them a -2 penalty to all
defenses (save ends). This is <em>not</em> a fear effect, so protection from fear
doesn’t work against it.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, it can use the dreaded <strong>Finger of Death</strong> spell (ranged 5
vs. Fortitude). This can only be used against a bloodied target, but if it hits
the target immediately drops to 0 HP. Necrotic resistance is useless against
this! It’s a nice thing to use with an action point as soon as someone becomes
bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 nightwalker, 4 bodak reavers. Master and minions!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 nightwalker, 1 tormenting ghost, 3 death giants. This would be
more of a gathering of equals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those encounters cover the basics of how you can meet a nightwalker: they bow to
no master, and surround themselves with either servants (all of the bodaks) or
with other creatures they respect as equals.</p>

<p>I like the concept of nightwalkers a lot, though I have to say I prefer the 3e
illustration that included nightcrawlers and nightwings. Those shadowy
indistinct shapes were a lot scarier than the thing pictured here. I can see why
the crawlers and wings didn’t make it here - they were basically the same
monster with different shapes and levels. It would be relatively easy to
homebrew them back into the game.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In the real world, a nightmare is a bad dream. In D&amp;D it’s a bad pun that
nevertheless became somewhat iconic. They’re only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A nightmare looks like a horse, but is darker and edgier. Night Mare, get it?
These creatures are native to the Shadowfell, and the only equine thing about
them is their general shape.</p>

<p>Nightmares are intelligent, carnivorous, and evil. In the wild they roam in
packs, like wolves, and have a taste for sapient flesh. They can be ridden and
are particularly prized as mounts by powerful servants of evil. Getting a
nightmare to agree to work as a mount involves defeating it in combat and making
it choose between service and death. Therefore, having a nightmare of your own
is a sign that you’re a badass in addition to being an edgelord.</p>

<p>Though they are native to the Shadowfell, their high resistance to fire and
fiery appearance make me think they have something of Hell in them as
well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single Nightmare stat block: it’s a Large Shadow Magical Beast
with the Mount keyword, and a Level 13 skirmisher with 138 HP. It has Darkvision
and trained Perception, and both land and <em>teleport</em> speeds of 10. This does
mean it can teleport at will as a move action.</p>

<p>Nightmares have 20 fire resistance, and get +2 to AC against opportunity
attacks. Their mount trait is <strong>Hell’s Ride</strong>, which grants 20 fire resistance
to the rider.</p>

<p>Nightmares fight in melee with their flame-wreathed <strong>hooves</strong>, which do a bit
of physical damage and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Their special attack is
<strong>Hooves of Hell</strong> (recharge 5-6), in which they run the speed and leave a
10-foot tall wall of fire in their wake. The wall lasts for a turn and deals 10
fire damage to anyone who enters it. Anyone who attacks the nightmare while it
makes this move also takes the same damage.</p>

<p>I imagine a nightmare has little reason to stand still while Hooves of Hell is
charged. It will play Fire Tron with the PCs for as long as it can, only
stopping to kick someone while it waits for the power to recharge. And unlike a
Tron bike it can run through its own walls just fine, even with a rider. A whole
pack of them would be, well, a nightmare to fight for PCs who aren’t resistant
to fire.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 nightmare, 1 battle wight commander (the rider), and 6 battle
wights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: a medusa archer and a medusa warrior riding nightmares.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like the mount rules give enemy riders and their mounts separate
actions, so that wight and the medusas can still attack the PCs while their
nightmare mounts run around setting the map on fire. When they provoke
opportunity attacks, the PCs can choose whether to target the mount or the
rider. In this case I would also have an opportunity attack against the rider
cause those 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>Despite the somewhat punny name, nightmares are cool. An evil knight type should
have an evil mount to go with it, and evil fire-horses are one of the classics
(the other being some kind of skeleton or wyvern).</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/08/07/better-than-bad.html">Better Than Bad: A Shadowrun Supplement Review</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Older Shadowrun core books used to include this charming in-world dictionary
entry that defined the term “shadowrunning” as doing illegal or semi-legal acts
for money. A shadowrunner a criminal by definition, but in a setting where
the laws are written by evil corporations and their bigoted puppet governments,
that definition leaves <em>plenty</em> of room for heroic characters of many kinds.</p>

<p>From the tail end of Fourth Edition onwards, however, it seems the game’s
publisher started interpreting that dictionary entry in the narrowest way
possible: “Criminals are bad, m’kay?”. From that point on it portrayed
shadowrunners as amoral assholes who work for truly horrible monsters doing
truly horrible shit as long as the money is good. And that’s not the game I want
to play. Shortly after the dismal supplement “War!”, I got out of the game<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Whenever I write about my feelings on the matter in the RPG.net forum, a couple
of very nice freelance Shadowrun authors always point me towards <em>Better than
Bad</em>, a 2018 supplement for Fifth Edition, telling me it’s an attempt at
reversing this trend. When it came up as part of a Bundle of Holding alongside a
couple other setting books, I decided to check it out. This is a review of
<em>Better Than Bad</em>. Reviews of the other books might come later.</p>

<p>The goal of <em>Better Than Bad</em> is to provide support for “hooding”
campaigns. Hooding is a bit of Shadowrun slang that’s been around for a while,
and originally referred to missions where the goal was to “rob from the rich and
give to the poor” Robin Hood style. This book broadens the definition to any
mission where the PC’s main goal is more altruistic than financial.</p>

<p>Does the book succeed at its stated goal? Well, it tries to, while fighting
itself every step of the way. It fights itself with such tenacity that I wonder
if there was a corresponding real-world struggle between its writers and
editors.</p>

<p>The supplement starts with a real downer of an introduction: “Are your do-gooder
runners going to change the world? Probably not - too much money and power are
arrayed against them.”  Gee thanks, book. I was nurturing some hope there for a
moment.</p>

<p>The focus here is going to be in “fixing some damage, righting some wrongs, and
making the lives of a few people better”. Which is all well and good in general
terms, but still comes off as disappointing when presented as the absolute limit
of what a group of PCs can accomplish.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, if you want to be realistic about it, there’s only so much a group
of 4-5 people can do to enact large-scale change in an unjust society, even if
they’re badass action heroes. But if you’re going to be realistic about it you
have to go all the way and state that the best way to enact this change is
through <em>collective action</em> and give some support for that. Lancer does
it. Sigmata does it. Does Better Than Bad do it? Eh, not really.</p>

<p>This introduction and a couple of short sections at the end are the only parts
of <em>Better than Bad</em> that are written in an out-of-character, authorial
voice. The rest of the text is written in an in-character voice using the
traditional framing device of BBS/forum posts interspersed with comments from
other users. For SR4 and 5, that BBS is Jackpoint, a small network with a more
or less constant cast of commenters and the occasional invited guest. This
format is known as “shadowtalk” by SR fans, a term which is also used to refer
specifically to the comments.</p>

<p>The major sections of the book are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Lights in the Darkness”: A list of activist organizations who might hire
runners for “hooding”-type jobs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Fixer-Upper Opportunities”: A list of specific examples of such jobs meant to
act as plot hooks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Pretoria, Hurrah”: A big chunk of pages presenting the Pretoria metroplex in
Azania (former South Africa) as a setting. Despite the name it also includes
Johannesburg and lots of other cities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Jacaranda Citizens”: A large list of NPCs who live there in the Pretoria
metroplex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Being Less Bad”: A chapter on more general hooding advice, and on what makes
a hooder different from a “standard” shadowrunner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Building a Hooder”/”Hooder Runs”: The afore-mentioned short sections of
mechanical bits and bobs, including a Random Hooding Run Generator.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These sections are separated by short fiction pieces.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-parts">The Good Parts</h2>

<p>There are a few good things about this book I must acknowledge. The untitled
fiction piece at the start of “Fixer-Upper Opportunities” is really good! The
others are “just” okay, but still a sight better than a lot of the bleak stuff I
read in other SR books.</p>

<p>“Being Less Bad” also contained some interesting information, and I particularly
liked the way it emphasized that a hooder has a much close relationship with
their community than your standard runner.</p>

<p>Most of the Pretoria NPCs are presented as potential employers, with specific
goals and interests as well as specific types of job they like to offer. This is
a very large leap in quality from older supplements like “Prime Runners”, whose
NPCs seemed to be mostly intended to overshadow the PCs.</p>

<p>The mechanical bits and bobs seem cool, conceptually speaking. I’m not fluent
enough in SR5 to say whether they’re well-implemented, and they have little to
do with the theme of the book, but they’re nifty. There’s magically resistant
armor and the magically resistant tattoos some geniuses made from the paint
extracted from that armor. There are spells that can strip a spirit’s immunity
so your gunslinger buddy can shoot them as if they were flesh. And there are
several “life modules” that must plug into some sort of lifepath system and that
<em>do</em> bear a relation to the book’s theme.</p>

<p>Those are the good parts. Now for the not so good ones.</p>

<h2 id="style-and-organization-issues">Style and Organization Issues</h2>

<p>We need to talk about shadowtalk.</p>

<p>The shadowtalk format works really well for “news”- or “travelogue”-style
sections, since it allows the shadow-randos to chime in with the truth behind
the official version of the facts and provide the reader with plot hooks. It
lends the whole thing a very subjective air, emphasizing that nothing you read
here is necessarily true. The main text certainly isn’t the whole truth, and
most of the comments are all about rumor, hearsay, and personal opinions. These
traits make it possible for a GM to take the information as a baseline and shape
it as they want.</p>

<p>And it’s these exact same traits that make shadowtalk about the worst possible
format for <em>advice</em> chapters. I was honestly a bit baffled when I saw that
Better Than Bad chose to use it for explaining to the reader what hooding is and
how to run a hooding campaign.</p>

<p>You can’t go two paragraphs without some amoral amoeba popping in with a hot
take on how the entire concept of altruism is complete bullshit and only a fool
would ever choose to practice hooding. This kinda muddles the message a bit,
y’know? Makes me wonder why I spent money on a book that calls me names for
being interested in its premise<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You’re also no longer getting the official authorial stance of the game on
something, but some shadow-rando’s opinion. As a result the main body of text
also fights itself, with at least one instance where the “Being Less Bad”
section disagrees with “Lights in the Darkness” because they’re written by
different fictional authors. And since they’re separated by the huge chapters on
Pretoria and its NPCs, it takes a while to get the full picture if you read
through the book linearly.</p>

<p>Shadowtalk can also be useful to insert brief humorous exchanges that break long
info-dump passages, but they don’t do that in this book. Rather, they spend
space in long conversations between mysterious big shots who only ever speak in
vague allusions to the lore of We’re No Longer Legally Allowed to Say It’s
Earthdawn.</p>

<p>Plus the decision to present the Pretoria NPC list in-character means Jackpoint
ends up doxxing the mysterious Zorro expy who’s supposed to be one of the city’s
greatest forces for good. Way to go, chummers.</p>

<p>If it were up to me, the advice sections and the NPC list would have been
rewritten as out-of-character, authorial-voice pieces with the extra space
dedicated to a White Wolf-style discussion of themes and motifs for a hooding
campaign.</p>

<h2 id="content-issues">Content Issues</h2>

<p>You’d expect that a book named Better Than Bad would want you to stand up for
people and things that are, you know, better than bad. The ways in which this
book fights itself, however, make it so that’s not always the case.</p>

<p>Like, that list of activist organizations which your hooder PCs might work for?
It includes a couple of literal terrorist groups. I’m not talking about “the
corps say these people are terrorists but that’s a lie”. I’m talking about
“these people would absolutely blow up a train station full of innocents to get
at one bad guy.” Now, the text doesn’t really condone the violence, and if you
go all the way to the other end of the book you’ll see that the general advice
section also includes a full condemnation… but it <em>really</em> muddles the message
to lump them in with the potential employers.</p>

<p>The Pretoria chapter is quite long but I’m not sure I’d use the setting as
presented. In terms of real-world knowledge of the region I’m just another
ignorant foreigner, so I can only speak of my own impressions of what I read in
this book. And I get that this is a cyberpunk setting, so it has to focus on
economic and social inequality to some extend, particularly in a book dedicated
to fighting it.</p>

<p>But you see, the city is under a sort of er, well, apartheid. There are actual
laws that make it so people are segregated into different districts based on
their financial status plus tribal and/or corporate affiliation, and any citizen
caught in an area “above their station” must have papers proving they’re allowed
to be there.</p>

<p>And there’s this bit at the start where the fictional author of the piece (a
shadow-rando named “Afrikaaner”) actually seems to <em>defend</em> this situation by
calling it “a status quo that while not fair is the way of life in
Pretoria”. This is in bad taste, right? It’s not just me that thinks so? Sure,
the corps he’s speaking against want to put something worse in place (“everyone
poor or SINless is now a slave in an diamond mine geofront”), but again this is
Better Than Bad, not Settling for Segregation.</p>

<p>The “Being Less Bad” section, which I’ve praised before, is not without its
share of “yikes!”. For starters, it lists cops as potential employers of
hooders, with the example job being a detective who hires runners to plant
evidence so they can arrest someone. It suffices to say that This Did Not Age
Well.</p>

<p>It also contains several side boxes about how as a hooder you’re going to suffer
from all sorts of psychological trauma and from an inevitable crisis of
conscience due to the “inherent contradiction” of wanting to do good things
while being a criminal. “Criminals are bad, m’kay?” is apparently still the
order of the day, so the assumption here is that PCs are <em>still</em> doing all sorts
of horrible shit and constantly hurting people even if their stated intentions
are good.</p>

<p>Do “evil” shadowrunners get subjected to the same hazards in other books?
Because if they don’t, the aggregate message kinda adds to “just be evil
already”. I can definitely see your typical asshole Shadowrun GM penalizing
players of altruistic PCs for not roleplaying their trauma while letting the
amoral assassin live their best/worst life unimpeded.</p>

<p>And finally, there’s a significant chance the random mission generator gives you
a run where <em>all</em> of the following are true: Mr. Johnson is a villain in
disguise, opposition is overwhelming, completing the mission makes the world a
worse place, and the group gets double-crossed at the end. I got something very
close to that with my test roll. I’ll show these tables to the next person who
says Shadowrun never intended this sort of thing to be common.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m told buying this Better Than Bad is a way to convince the publishers of
Shadowrun that it’s worth their time to support a less relentlessly bleak vision
of their setting. I sure hope that this is the case, because reading this book
made it clear that they don’t really <em>want</em> to. It does have some good bits,
unlike the completely execrable “War!”, but I don’t think I’d pay full price for
it.</p>

<p>The now woefully out of print Leverage RPG gives the subject a much better
treatment, used to cost the same, and also included a lot of other excellent
rules for running cinematic heists. It wouldn’t take a lot of effort to adapt
those to Shadowrun. I really wish someone made a white-label version of it
available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Lancer RPG costs only a little bit more and has strong
support for campaigns where PCs can enact large-scale change in a society
through being part of collective action and getting into giant robot fights.</p>

<p>want to say I got angry when I found out Clockwork is still around and allowed
to post on Jackpoint. I expected them to have better moderation standards. After
what happened back in Emergence I’d also expect someone to nail Clockwork’s head
to Fastjack’s front door along with a printed essay on the paradox of tolerance.</p>

<p>Nagas are inspired by creatures from Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist
tradition. Stories about them originate from both India and Laos. They’ve been
in D&amp;D since at least AD&amp;D 1e, and here they’re present only in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Nagas are serpentine creatures with humanoid faces, more spirit than flesh. They
are the guardians of sacred places and secret lore, immune to the ravages of
age, hunger, or sleep.</p>

<p>Nagas are sapient, highly intelligent, and possess magical powers. While the
book doesn’t specify who exactly summons nagas to guard some secret, I imagine
powerful servants of the gods or other equivalent entities might have the
ability to do so. You’ll rarely find a naga guarding an easily accessible place
like a big city temple or the like - remoteness is the first line of defense for
the sites they tend to guard.</p>

<p>Nagas are often fond of treasure, and end up building small hoards out of the
belongings of the interlopers they defeat. Some of them grow to despise their
original mission, and install themselves as divine rulers of primitive reptilian
tribes, over which they seem to have some influence. As you might expect, the
servants of Zehir are among some of the most enthusiastic fans of nagas, though
they’re not inherently associated with that deity.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nagas are Large Magical Beasts with the Reptile keyword. Their origin is
typically Immortal, but that can vary. They have Darkvision, very high Int
scores, speak several languages, and have plenty of mental skills, such as
Arcana, Insight, History, and so on. Their specific powers vary per stat block,
but there’s always something snaky and something magical.</p>

<h3 id="guardian-naga">Guardian Naga</h3>

<p>This naga is Level 12 Elite Artillery with 186 HP. In previous editions they
used to be always Lawful Good, but here their alignment is listed as
“any”. Presumably it matches that of whoever summoned them as guardians. They
usually guard arcane secrets, rituals, or artifacts, as well as portals to the
Astral Sea. They move at speed 6.</p>

<p>The guardian naga will likely open a fight with <strong>Thunderstrike</strong> (area burst 1
within 20 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6), which does thunder damage and dazes on a
hit (save ends). On a miss it still does half damage, with no riders.</p>

<p>From them on it will hit its enemies with <strong>Word of Pain</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will),
doing psychic damage and immobilizing (save ends). It will likely spread this
around so most PCs are immobilized, and then focus on what it perceives to be
the biggest threats.</p>

<p>If someone manages to get close, it will <strong>Spit Poison</strong> at them (close blast 3
vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). This does immediate and ongoing poison damage, and
it also inflicts a -2 penalty to Fortitude and saves (save ends all).</p>

<p>Only when it has no other alternative will the guardian naga fight in melee. Its
only weapon there are weak <strong>Tail Slaps</strong> that do some damage and push 2 squares
on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="bone-naga">Bone Naga</h3>

<p>This skeletal naga is a Level 16 Elite Controller with 328 HP. As an undead
being, it’s immune to disease and poison, has Resist 20 necrotic, and Vulnerable
10 Radiant. It rattles along at speed 7.</p>

<p>Despite their sinister looks and undead-ness, bone nagas are Unaligned. Their
mission usually involves guarding dangerous necromantic secrets, or tombs where
some great evil is sealed.</p>

<p>Bone nagas prefer to mix it up in melee, in no small part due to their <strong>Death
Rattle</strong> aura (radius 2) which causes any enemy who starts their turn inside to
be dazed! It reinforces that with its <strong>Death Sway</strong> (Close Burst 3 vs. Will),
which dazes enemies who were previously fine (save ends) and does necrotic
damage to enemies who were already dazed.</p>

<p>It also has a Reach 2 <strong>Bite</strong> it can use, which deals immediate and necrotic
damage (save ends), with a weakness aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="dark-naga">Dark Naga</h3>

<p>So named because of its dark-colored scales, this naga is also Evil. That says
nothing about the moral value of what it guards: prophecies, oracles, related
relics and rituals, and Underdark sites. It is probably more likely to set up
one of those cults mentioned in the lore, though.</p>

<p>Dark Nagas are Level 21 Elite Controllers, with 404 HP and speed 8. They’re all
about mind effects at close range, starting with <strong>Lure</strong> (Close Burst 5
vs. Will; enemies only). This minor action pulls victims 1 square and dazes them
(save ends), though it does no damage.</p>

<p><strong>Psychic Miasma</strong> (Close Burst 3 vs. Will; recharge 5-6) <em>does</em> do psychic
damage in addition to its daze effect (save ends). The first failed save here
causes the condition to worsen to stunned (save ends).</p>

<p>Their <strong>tail sting</strong> does poison damage, and is more damaging against dazed
targets. It also slows them (save ends).</p>

<p>In short, the party will have a very hard time staying un-dazed when fighting
these monsters.</p>

<h3 id="primordial-naga">Primordial Naga</h3>

<p>The only elemental naga of the bunch (all others are Immortal), this hints that
the first nagas served not the gods, but the primordials. This multi-headed
monstrosity is a Level 25 Solo Artillery with 1200 HP, comparable to an elder
dragon. They guard portals to the Elemental Chaos, and the secrets of the
primordials themselves.</p>

<p>Primordial nagas prefer to maintain a good distance between themselves and their
foes, whom they will bombard with their <strong>fire spit</strong> and with <strong>wind
slams</strong>. The first targets Reflex and does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage. The second does physical damage and pushes the target 2 squares. Both
are minor actions, allowing a stationary naga to make a total of three such
attacks in any combination.</p>

<p>When the PCs close to within 5 squares, it will hit them with a <strong>Freezing
Breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) which does cold damage and
slows (save ends).</p>

<p>And when the PCs finally close to melee, they’ll have a nasty surprise:
primordial nagas are actually quite dangerous up close! First there’s the
<strong>Energy Cascade</strong> aura (2) which does 10 fire and lightning damage to any
enemies inside. Then there are the <strong>bites</strong>. They might be bit weaker than the
ranged attacks, but the naga can make five of them. If at least three hit the
same target, they also take ongoing acid damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These are the sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: A guardian naga, 2 fire archon emberguards, 1 stone-eye basilisk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: 1 Bone Naga, 3 shadow snakes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nagas usually partner up with other guardian creatures assigned to the same
place, and they can also end up allying or enslaving neighboring creatures to
act as spies and agents, either to help with their mission of protection or to
build a power base and take over the surrounding region. The latter is something
the more evil or ambitious nagas might do.</p>

<p>I like nagas! Their lore has plenty of openings for interactions more complex
than a fight to the death, and they have a nice mechanical flavor.</p>
