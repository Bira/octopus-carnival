<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Adamantine dragons are the first metallics we’ll cover. I finally found a wiki
with publication histories for monsters, so I can say that that they first
appeared in a Monstrous Compendium for AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, and in a Dragon article
for 3.x. This means they had a minor presence in the game until their first
proper Monster Manual appearance here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Adamantine dragons like to lair in huge underground caverns, and can be found in
any sort of climate. They consider everyone else living in their claimed
territory to be their subjects, from whom they demand loyalty, respect, and
tribute. The flip-side of this is that adamantine dragons feel a genuine sense
of <em>noblesse oblige</em> towards these subjects, and will protect them with all
their might.</p>

<p>Their claws and fangs are made of their titular metal, so their attacks slice
through armor as if it wasn’t there. Their roars are powerful, and their breath
weapon is a focused sonic attack. In combat, they’re cool-headed and
tactical. If alone, they try to isolate weaker foes and focus fire on them. If
accompanied by allies, they’ll charge to the front line and attract the brunt of
enemy attacks to allow their allies more opportunities to damage the
opposition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual, we get stat blocks representing four age categories: Young, Adult,
Elder, and Ancient. All are Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon keyword. All
stat blocks are Unaligned.</p>

<p>Adamantine dragons start at size Large, growing to Huge at Elder and Gargantuan
at Ancient. They have trained Perception, Darkvision, and Thunder Resistance
that starts at 15 and goes up by 5 on each subsequent age category. Their ground
speed starts at 6 and rises to 8 on Adult and older. Their flight speed starts
at 8 and rises to 10 on Adult and 12 on Ancient. They also have Overland
Flight 15, which is the speed you use when calculating how much distance they
cover over extended times.</p>

<h3 id="young-adamantine-dragon">Young Adamantine Dragon</h3>

<p>This is a Level 7 Solo Soldier with 332 HP and the traits described above. Its
basic attacks are a <strong>bite</strong> and a <strong>claw</strong>, both of which target Reflex instead
of AC because they’re adamantine. The bite is a little stronger, <strong>Double
Attack</strong> allows the dragon to claw twice in a single action.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) does thunder
damage and knocks the targets prone on a hit. It replaces the usual “half damage
on a miss” with a much more interesting Effect: at the start of the dragon’s
next turn, it gives a thunderous roar that deals automatic thunder damage to
everyone in a close burst 3.</p>

<p><strong>Bloodied Breath</strong> and <strong>Frightful Presence</strong> are here, and they work as
outlined in the intro.</p>

<p><strong>Wing Buffet</strong> (melee 2 vs. Fortitude) is a reaction that triggers when an
enemy enters or leaves an adjacent square. On a hit it deals light physical
damage and knocks prone. This is better than a standard opportunity attack
because it also triggers on a shift or other forms or movement.</p>

<h3 id="adult-adamantine-dragon">Adult Adamantine Dragon</h3>

<p>Adults are Level 14 Solo Soldiers with 564 HP. Their numbers are of course all
larger, but they are almost identical to young dragons in what they can do.</p>

<p>There have been a few additions: the bite now also inflicts ongoing damage (save
ends), and Double Attack is replaced by <strong>Draconic Fury</strong>, which allows them to
make three claw attacks <em>and</em> bite a different target in a single action.</p>

<h3 id="elder-adamantine-dragon">Elder Adamantine Dragon</h3>

<p>Elders are Level 21 Solo Soldiers with 796 HP. They have everything adults have,
with a few additions:</p>

<p>Their <strong>Draconic Fury</strong> gains another claw attack, for a total of four claws and
a bite. They also gain a new attack named <strong>Painful Resonance</strong> (Ranged 20
vs. Fortitude; minor action; recharge 6) that inflicts ongoing thunder damage
and dazes (save ends). Since this is a minor action, it can be used in the same
turn as Draconic Fury.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-adamantine-dragon">Ancient Adamantine Dragon</h3>

<p>Ancients are Level 28 Solo Soldiers with 1020 HP. This puts makes them a match
for a pair of primordial colossi. They have everything elders have, plus their
melee reach increases to 4 and the area of their Breath Weapon’s follow-up roar
increases to 5.</p>

<p>They also gain a new trait named <strong>Bloodied Resilience</strong>, which gives them
Resist 10 to all damage while they are bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book doesn’t even pretend you’re going to fight these solos by themselves,
though that of course is an option depending on what you want. Since adamantine
dragons place themselves in the front line, they favor allies who can benefit
from the distraction to rain ranged damage or control upon the enemy, or give
the PCs the run-around and hit their squishies. And they’re going to think of
party composition in these terms, since they’re tacticians.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 15, an adult adamantine dragon and 2 banshrae
warriors.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Woohoo, more dragons. The first Monster Manual (and the Vault) focused on
chromatic dragons, which are the classic draconic opponents, and now the second
one talks about the metallics.</p>

<p>The earliest metallic dragons were the Golds, who appeared alongside the
chromatic set in AD&amp;D 1st Edition and might have been around even earlier than
that. Here, we’re going to look at a slightly different set. This is an
introductory post, with the next handful of them each covering a different
“color” of dragon.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In editions past, metallic dragons used to be various shades of Good, something
which settings like Dragonlance really leaned into. Things are a bit more
complex here.</p>

<p>Metallics still venerate Bahamut in his role as the Platinum Dragon. They’re
more likely to interact peacefully with PCs and other sapients, but they can
still be quite full of themselves and are very protective of their territory and
treasure. If they perceive someone as a threat, they won’t hesitate to crush
that someone. And just like you can have friendly chromatics, you can also have
villainous metallics.</p>

<p>In either case they tend to have a scholarly temperament. They prefer lairs that
have some cultural or academic significance in addition to the usual
requirements of isolation and defensibility and their treasure hoards are
curated like museum collections. The typical metallic dragon loves engaging in
learned discourse, and has a keen ability to sense lies. They deal very harshly
with people who try to fool or, gods forbid, steal from them.</p>

<p>Like all dragons they see very few other creatures as their peers, but will
allow a group of “lessers” to gather around themselves. They tend to see these
as students and wards, instead of slaves and worshippers. A metallic dragon is
not going to set itself up as a god, but as a <em>university professor</em>.</p>

<p>This entry has five dragon types: Adamantine, Copper, Gold, Iron and
Silver. From what I gather, Adamantine and Iron dragons made it into the main
metallic lineup in 4e to replace bronze and brass dragons, which weren’t
distinct enough from Copper dragons at a glance. I think I agree with that
reasoning. While I’m sure these dragons have their own mechanical distinctions,
I sure can’t recall what they were just from looking at their names.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual for dragons, the ones we get here are all solos, and each has several
stat blocks representing different age categories: Young, Adult, Elder and
Ancient. Young dragons only have the most basic versions of their powers, and
both improve them and gain new ones as they age. Their mechanical design is
closer to that of the first Monster Manual than to the one from the Vault.</p>

<p>All dragons have darkvision, resistance to the same element they breathe, and
both combat and overland flight speeds. All of them get a different <strong>Breath
Weapon</strong>, as well as the <strong>Bloodied Breath</strong> trait and the <strong>Frightful
Presence</strong> attack.</p>

<p>Bloodied Breath works as usual: when the dragon is first bloodied, its breath
weapon recharges and it uses it immediately as a free action. Frightful Presence
is a Close Burst 10 vs. Will encounter power that does no damage but stuns for a
turn and has a -2 attack penalty (save ends) as an after-effect.</p>

<p>We’ll begin discussing the dragon types individually in the next few posts.</p>

<p>Djinns are inspired by the same real world Arabic folklore that inspired
efreets, and they’ve been in the game since at least BECMI.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Djinns are some of the most ancient sapient elementals, on par with efreets
(which we saw in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/11/efreet.html">first Monster Manual/Vault Let’s Read</a>). They’re
aspected to Air, and in the book’s own words, are “Ingenious Engineers of the
Fabulous”.</p>

<p>Back in the day, the djinn built entire civilizations in the Elemental
Chaos. Theirs were shining palaces filled with treasure beyond mortal
comprehension, and great gleaming cities built on mobile floating
platforms.</p>

<p>When the Dawn War came, the djinns chose to side with the primordials, which I
suppose they saw as the pragmatic choice. After all, their own empire was
outside the world, and the stronger primordials looked like they had a better
chance of winning. In the end, though, they chose wrong.</p>

<p>The gods scattered the djinns as punishment for their deeds in the war, and
imprisoned many of them in objects such as rings, lamps, or other artifacts. The
ones that remained free had their powers severely reduced. Over the ages a lot
of those artifacts and a lot of djinn relics made their way to other planes and
to the world.</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s totally possible for a PC to find the proverbial magic lamp. It’s
up to the GM whether the magic that binds the djinn inside forces it to serve
the bearer, though. If it does, then these relics are super-powerful! Even if
the djinn can’t grant wishes like in the stories, it’s still an epic-level
creature full of magic powers.</p>

<p>The djinns who remained free, and those who freed themselves over the ages,
mostly busy themselves with roaming the planes looking for the remains of their
ancient civilization, with the goal of rebuilding it. I would guess they had
some success in that, but that it’s still nowhere up to its former heights of
glory.</p>

<p>The djinns presented here are all Unaligned, which implies that as a people they
are mostly interested in picking up the pieces of their civilization than in
going a-conquering or enslaving others. They can still get into conflict with
PCs who (knowingly or not) keep those pieces from returning to their original
owners. Hold on to that lamp for too long and its inhabitant’s friends will show
up at your door with some very pointed questions. I can’t say they’d be wrong to
do so.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Djinns are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Air keyword. They have Blindsight
10, an immunity to disease and poison, Resist 15 Thunder, a ground speed of 6
and a flight speed of 8. The least intelligent djinn in this entry nas an Int of
19, so the ingenious engineers are also geniuses. Their level range covers the
early-to-mid Epic tier, making them only slightly weaker than efreets.</p>

<p>Most djinn powers have an air or storm theme, but they vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="djinn-thunderer">Djinn Thunderer</h3>

</figure>

<p>Thunderers are Level 20 Artillery with 146 HP and all djinn traits. They wield
jeweled scepters and strong air magic in combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>Scepter</strong> mostly acts as an implement, but can be used as a Reach 2 basic
melee attack in a pinch. Their main ranged attack is a <strong>Thunderburst</strong> (area
burst 2 within 20 vs. Fortitude), which does thunder damage and dazes for a
turn. Once per encounter they can use <strong>Imperious Thunder</strong>, which targets
Reflex and which has the same area and damage but instead of dazing causes 10
ongoing thunder damage (save ends) <em>even when it misses</em>.</p>

<p>The thunderer can avoid getting boxed in with <strong>Zephyr Step</strong> (minor; recharge
6), which allows it to teleport 20 squares. If it takes damage from a critical
hit, it will respond with <strong>Rage of Storms</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; free
action, encounter). This does high thunder damage, pushes hit targets 5 squares,
and gives the djinn 1 action point as an effect, which it can use normally later
on.</p>

<h3 id="djinn-windbow">Djinn Windbow</h3>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>Windbows are Level 22 Skirmishers with 204 HP and all standard djinn
traits. They wield bows that fire arrows made out of wind, and this might lead
PCs to think they’re artillery. However, they’re equally good at melee and
ranged combat.</p>

<p>Their basic ranged attack is the <strong>Windbow</strong> (Ranged 10/20), and their basic
melee attack the <strong>Slash of Thunder</strong>. Both do about the same amount of damage,
which is thunder for the Slash and physical for the bow.</p>

<p>The djinn can cause one of their arrows to turn into a <strong>Brutal Zephyr</strong> (Ranged
30 vs. Reflex), which does thunder damage and is a bit stronger than the usual
attack. If this misses, the windbow gets to choose a different target within 10
squares of the original one and re-roll the attack against them.</p>

<p>If damaged by a critical hit they can use <strong>Blowback</strong>, which works exactly like
the Thunderer’s Rage of Storms.</p>

<h3 id="djinn-stormsword">Djinn Stormsword</h3>

</figure>

<p>Stormswords fight with scimitars and train to form whirlwinds that pull enemies
towards their blades. They’re Level 24 Soldiers with 222 HP and all standard
djinn traits, plus Resist 15 Lightning.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Scimitars</strong> are Reach 2, high-crit weapons that mark for a turn on a
hit. Their printed critical damage is 9d10+33, and it would be even higher with
a math fix. They can also use a technique named <strong>Whirlwind Dervish</strong> (close burst 2
vs. AC; encounter) which does heavy thunder and lightning damage and recharges
when they’re critically hit.</p>

<p>Stormswords can drag targets into range with <strong>Come To Me</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude; minor action), which does no damage but pulls the targets 5
squares. They can sometimes intensify that into a <strong>Spinning Vortex</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex; recharge 6), which does heavy cold and thunder damage, and
immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="djinn-skylord">Djinn Skylord</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-djinn-skylord.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Skylords are djinn spell-casters, specializing in sky- and weather-themed
magic. They’re Level 25 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 236 HP along
with all standard djinn traits.</p>

<p>Their main weapon/implement is the <strong>Storm Staff</strong> (reach 2 vs. AC), which does
physical damage and allows the djinn to shift 2 squares or make an extra
recharge roll for <strong>Storm Shout</strong>. This, in turn, is a Close Blast 5 vs. Will
that does heavy thunder damage, pushes 3 squares, and knocks prone. It recharges
on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The skylord’s main ranged attack is <strong>Mystic Hail</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will), which
does psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage to the
djinn. This lasts until the target spends a standard action clearing their head,
which is a heavier cost than having to roll a save. This works as a nice setup
for <strong>Sandstorm</strong> (Close Burst 5 vs. Will), which does heavy physical damage and
creates a zone. Allies inside the zone gain concealment, and enemies starting
their turns inside are dazed for a turn. This can be sustained with a minor
action. And finally, the djinn can also use a minor action (1/round) to use
<strong>Elemental Command</strong> (ranged 10), which always hits, does no damage, and slides
the target 1 square.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Djinns are said to mostly hang out with their own kind, and the two sample
encounters (level 22 and 26) bear this out. They’re assorted djinn parties,
likely journeying after relics of their old empire. The first one has a couple
of rimefire griffon pets, the second has 2 storm gorgons.</p>

<p>Djinns are cool, and I like that they’re presented as not necessarily
hostile. Unlike in previous edition they’re not in an eternal war against the
efreets, though I imagine they don’t often have friendly interactions all that
often either. It might also be interesting to take a page from Middle Eastern
folklore here and say that many djinn in the present are devout worshippers of
the gods.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I had never heard of direguards before, but some quick googling tells me they
first appeared in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting for AD&amp;D 2nd Edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A direguard is a skeletal undead created by a specific ritual often known by
liches and death knights. The ritual requires willing subjects, who retain their
minds, combat skills, and powers. This comes at a price, however: in the book’s
own words, they must “meet a quota of killing”, or they’ll be destroyed. I don’t
know if this is a one time thing or if it’s more like “kill X people every
month”. And of course they’re bound to the will of their creator.</p>

<p>Their FR lore is all tangled up with the whole Bane/Cyric situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Direguards are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision and truesight 10, and are immune to disease and poison. The rest of
their traits varies per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="direguard-deathbringer">Direguard Deathbringer</h3>

<p>Deathbringers are Level 8 Elite Artillery with the Leader keyword and 134
HP. They have a ground speed of 7 and project a <strong>Command Aura</strong> (4) that grants
a +2 attack bonus to all allies inside. They can also issue a <strong>Vile Command</strong>
(close blast 3; recharge 5-6) that allows all affected allies to shift 2 squares
and make a basic attack as a free action.</p>

<p>They fire <strong>Force Blasts</strong> (Ranged 15 vs. Reflex) that do force damage and push
the target 3 squares. On a miss, they do no damage but slow the target for a
turn. <strong>Frightful Force</strong> (recharge 4-6) allows them to fire three such blasts
against different targets in a single action.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the deathbringer’s <strong>Blazing Bone Claws</strong> do force damage
as well. And when they’re first bloodied, they summon some <strong>Force Armor</strong>
around themselves that grants a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex until they’re hit by
an attack.</p>

<p>I’d say deathbringers are at home just behind the front line, or further back
along with a cluster of artillery enemies with ranged basic attacks.</p>

<h3 id="direguard-assassin">Direguard Assassin</h3>

<p>Assassins are Level 11 Skirmishers with 111 HP. They’re made of shadow as much
as they are made of bone, and fight with swords made of force magic. Their
ground speed is 8.</p>

<p>That <strong>Force Blade</strong> deals force damage, as expected, and once per encounter
they can fling <strong>Dire Blades</strong> to do the same amount of damage in a Close
Burst 1. <strong>Mobile Assault</strong> gives them a +2 attack bonus if they move at least 4
squares before attacking, and <strong>Mist Walk</strong> allows them to shift 2 squares and
gain Insubstantial and Phasing for a turn when missed by a melee attack.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are no sample encounters here! I guess they could only spare one page for
direguards, so there was no room.</p>

<p>I don’t care for the FR bits of their lore, but Deathbringers work nicely as
commanders of mindless undead, and Assassins are good elite troops for someone
like a skull lord to order around.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Dimensional marauders are a 3.x creation. I definitely remember that image,
though I don’t remember if they had a different name back then. It was probably
something like “Ethereal Marauder”, but 4e doesn’t have an ethereal plane
anymore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures are plane-hopping predators who travel the planes and the world
in search of easy prey. And that’s all the book has to say about them.</p>

<p>Let’s allow ourselves to speculate a bit. Dimensional marauders “travel the
planes”, and I guess that means they don’t have a fixed territory and follow
sources of food instead. If you look at their stat block you’ll see their level
is a lot lower than that of almost any creature they’re likely to find in the
planes. This means they’re <em>opportunistic</em>, looking for creatures that have
already been weakened by some other hazard or who are busy fighting someone
else. Then they jump in and take a bite. If the meal is still kicking, they
might run away, otherwise they stay and finish it off.</p>

<p>Evolutionary pressure has given then a rudimentary sapience, which aids them in
evaluating the strength of potential prey. It also often leads marauders to the
conclusion that the easiest prey can be found in the world, near population
centers filled with juicy non-combatants whom they might even be able to beat in
a fair fight. Not that they’ll fight fair.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Dimensional Marauders are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts, and Level 4 Lurkers
with 45 HP. They have low-light vision, a ground speed of 7 and a teleport speed
of 3.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> with that cool triangular jaw. They can also
use their standard action to assume a <strong>Planephase Form</strong>, partially shifting to
some other plane. This gives them the Insubstantial and Phasing qualities for a
turn, or until they miss with an attack. They can also sustain this with a minor
action, but it ends immediately when they take psychic damage.</p>

<p>While in this state, the marauder can use a <strong>Reality Warp</strong> attack (melee 1
vs. Reflex), which does light physical damage, teleports the target 3 squares,
and teleports the marauder itself to a square adjacent to the target. It will
use this to isolate its chosen victim.</p>

<p>If the marauder is hit by a melee attack, it can use <strong>Planar Evasion</strong>
(recharge 4-6) as a reaction, teleporting 3 squares.</p>

<p>I see them mostly staying in planephase form and using Reality Warp to isolate a
PC, which they’ll begin biting for more damage once they’re far away. The book
tactics start them out entirely physical and has them planephase after hit for
the first time in combat, but there’s no reason for them not to planephase
before the fight even starts.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a group of sapients will convince a marauder to work with
them. Mostly, though, they just opportunistically jump into ongoing fights to
take a bite out of whoever seems weakest.</p>

<p>The sample encounter could represent either of these situations. It’s level 3,
with 2 marauders, 2 ettercap fang guards, and 1 gnome arcanist.</p>

<p>I think the illustration is very cool and memorable, but I only found the
creature itself interesting because of all the aprocryphal lore I came up with
in this post. Mechanically, I almost think it would work better as a Controller,
since its abilities are more about knocking PCs out of position than dealing
increased damage. If you give it some bonus sneak attack damage, it does work as
a Lurker.</p>
