            <p>Purple Worms have been in D&amp;D since at least the days of BECMI, and are likely
inspired by the sand worms of Frank Herbert’s Dune. They’re in both the Monster
Manual and Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, purple worms were not created by some drug-addled wizard or
vengeful primordial. They’re entirely natural creatures, just like cats and
dogs. Or drakes. Or behemoths. Or bullettes. Yeah, the world of D&amp;D is kind of a
dangerous place.</p>

<p>Large enough to swallow a giant whole, purple worms burrow through the Underdark
and through rocky and mountainous terrain on the surface. They’re not always
hungry, but their feeding strategy is gorging themselves about once a week so
the end result is more or less the same. They’re such efficient tunnelers that
you can’t tell they’re coming until they’re almost directly underneath you. They
also have a knack for showing up precisely when people think things can’t get
any worse. Large Underdark settlements are always protected by a perimeter of
anti-worm wards, and when these settlements war with each other sabotaging those
wards is a popular move.</p>

<p>Unlike the Dune sand worms, purple worms can burrow through solid rock just
fine, and in addition to their cavernous maws some have a venomous stinger on
the tip of their tails. They dig by eating the rock or soil and quickly
excreting it, though stuff like refined metal, precious ores and gems have a
tendency to stick in the worm’s gut for longer periods. So if you manage to kill
one, its gut may contain treasure!</p>

<p>Purple worm tunnels are very large and permanent, and they don’t reuse
them. An area rich in food might have several purple worms hunting it, and will
end up looking like a labyrinth. Worm tunnels tend to become important natural
roads in the Underdark, and it’s not uncommon for smaller creatures to move into
them right after the worm passes them by. Instant ecosystem!</p>

<p>These beasts are impossible to tame, but people keep trying to use magic to
control them. Drow and illithids can’t resist their potential as a weapon, and
dwarves can’t resist their potential as a construction tool. I mean, a purple
worm could likely have dug the tunnel under the English Channel in a fraction of
the time the real-world construction crew took.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s pretty much inevitable that these spells will wear off at the
worst possible time, leading to disaster. After digging the tunnel, that same
purple worm would have likely delivered a much quicker and less painful Brexit
by eating Britain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Purple Worms are Natural Beasts with the Blind keyword. They have both
tremorsense 20 and blindsight 10, plus a respectable burrow speed with
Tunneling. We have two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm">Purple Worm</h3>

<p>The basic model is Huge, and a Level 16 Solo Soldier with 780 HP. As a blind
creature, it’s immune to gaze attacks, and also immune to illusions. It crawls
at speed 6, and burrows at speed 3.</p>

<p>The worm’s basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> that, unlike most basic attacks in
the book, targets Reflex. No amount of armor is going to protect you from it!  A
hit does damage and grabs the target (Athletics DC 34 or Acrobatics DC 30 to
escape).</p>

<p>Once the worm has grabbed a target, it can “worry” it with its <strong>Clamping
Jaws</strong>, which has the same accuracy vs. Reflex and damage as a basic bite but
does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>It can also try to <strong>Swallow</strong> them. This targets the Fortitude of the
victim. On a hit, the target gets swallowed and is now inside the purple
worm. The victim is considered dazed and restrained, and only has line of sight
and effect to the worm. Also, no one has line of sight or effect to the victim.</p>

<p>While swallowed, the victim can only make basic attacks, and takes 10 physical
and 10 acid damage at the start of the worm’s turns. The only good news here is
that the worm’s AC is like 8 points lower from the inside. The only way to
escape is to kill the worm, which causes the victim to be regurgitated.</p>

<p>The worm can’t bite other people while it has a target grabbed in its jaws, but
it can fight normally after swallowing. There’s no mention of how many victims
fit in its gullet. “One” is the merciful answer, but “1 Large or 2 Medium or 4
Small” is traditional.</p>

<h3 id="elder-purple-worm">Elder Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Elder Purple Worms have grown to size Gargantuan (the largest possible under the
rules). They’re large enough to swallow titans! Elders are Level 24 Solo
Soldiers with 1145 HP and the same immunities as the younger specimen. Their
land speed is 8 and their burrowing speed 4.</p>

<p>The elder’s attacks are exactly the same as those of the basic worm, with bigger
numbers. Their AC is 7 points lower from the inside, and their digestive damage
is 20 physical and 20 acid per turn. Again there’s no mention of how many
creatures fit in the worm’s gullet. The traditional answer would be “1 Huge or 2
Large or 4 Medium or 8 Small”, but it might be a tad unfair to allow it to
swallow the whole party.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>Purple worms in the Vault are fairly different, and generally more adequate for
use as solo encounters. We also get two stat blocks, and both are Huge Natural
Beasts (blind).</p>

<h3 id="adult-purple-worm">Adult Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Adult Purple Worms are Level 14 Solo Brutes with 560 HP. Not sure if I
mentioned this before, but the new monster math also gives solos less HP. Their
tremorsense and blindsight are both range 10, and they both crawl and burrow at
speed 6.</p>

<p>As a MV Solo, this worm has some traits that help it stand up to a paragon
party: <strong>Ponderous</strong> allows it to take immediate actions while stunned, dazed,
or dominated; and <strong>Bloodied Frenzy</strong> allows it to take an extra minor action in
its turn while bloodied.</p>

<p>The basic Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> now targets AC, and has no riders to its considerable
damage. All the gizzard gimmicks are now packed into the <strong>Devour Whole</strong> attack
(Melee 3 vs. Fortitude). A hit here does similar damage to a bite and swallows
the target.</p>

<p>Being swallowed here is a little less nightmarish than for the MM version. The
restrictions on line of sight and effect still apply, and the victim is off the
board and so obviously can’t move around. However, they are no longer dazed or
restrained, and can use any of their attacks against the worm. They can even try
to crawl out of its gullet as if escaping from a grab, rolling against a lenient
DC of 21.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the worm’s defenses are the same from the inside
now. Swallowed victims take 30 acid damage at the end of their own turns, and
any close or area attacks used from inside the worm also target all other
creatures swallowed by it. While we still get no word on what’s the limit for
those, we do have explicit confirmation that there can be more than one. So you
can choose between the traditional answer and “no limit”!</p>

<p>This worm also has a lot of other options to bring pain to the party, all of
them minor actions. <strong>Fling</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude) deals damage and slides
the target 4 squares; <strong>Regurgitate</strong> spits out a swallowed victim, making it
appear within 4 squares of the worm and take a chunk of automatic damage; and
the <strong>Poison Stinger</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude)  mentioned in the Lore section
does a bit of physical damage and 15 ongoing poison damage (save ends). With
Bloodied Frenzy active, it can do all three and still swallow someone.</p>

<p>You also have <strong>Thrash</strong>, a reaction that triggers whenever an attack hits the
worm. It’s a Melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, targeting one or two creatures, doing
the same damage as the bite and pushing them up to 6 squares. This is why it has
Ponderous!</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm-tunneler">Purple Worm Tunneler</h3>

<p>This specimen is quite a bit faster, and likely the one you want to use for your
Eurotunnel/Brexit combo. It’s a Level 19 Solo Skirmisher with 728 HP. Its land
and burrow speeds are 8.</p>

<p>The tunneler has the same Ponderous and Bloodied Frenzy traits as the basic
model. Its <strong>Bite</strong> does damage and allows it to shift half its speed on a
hit. <strong>Devour Whole</strong> also works the same, with an escape DC of 24.</p>

<p>As a move action, the tunneler can <strong>Barrel Through</strong> its foes, shifting its
speed and making an attack against the Reflex of every enemy it passes adjacent
to. A hit here does a bit of damage and pushes the target 2 squares.</p>

<p>The tunneler also has a bigger stinger, since its minor-action attack is
<strong>Stinger Impalement</strong> (Melee 3 vs. AC). This does more physical damage than the
basic worm’s stinger, slides the target 4 squares, and deals 10 ongoing poison
damage (save ends). There’s no limit to the number of times per round it may do
this, so you’re looking at up to three impalement attacks plus a devouring when
the worm is bloodied.</p>

<p>Finally, it also has <strong>Thrash</strong>, which works the same way with bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual has a level 18 sample encounter: 1 purple worm, and 2 savage
minotaurs.</p>

<p>Purple worms don’t cooperate with anyone, of course, but they’ll often be
attracted by fights against other monsters and try to eat everyone present, just
like Bullettes but on a bigger scale. In other words, purple worms are just the
thing to use on a party who’s all happy that they’ve outgrown bullettes.</p>

<p>I like purple worms! I don’t think they’re exclusive content, but they’re still
a very D&amp;D kind of monster. In previous editions I kinda felt they suffered from
the same problem as dragons, looking so powerful that people rarely put them in
their games. Here, I have a better handle of when they’re appropriate.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Panthers are real-world animals, and something like them has been in the game
since the beginning. In 4e, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This is another one of those Monster Manual entries that focuses on fantastical
versions of a mundane animal. The implied setting of D&amp;D does have mundane
panthers, but the book notes that they mostly hunt small game and avoid contact
with people.</p>

<p>However, that setting also has <em>supernatural</em> panthers touched by the energies
of the Feywild and Shadowfell. These are larger, stronger, and have no problem
stalking humanoids that blunder into their hunting grounds. They have powers
that are thematic to their home planes, and can move between them and the world
at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one each for fey and shadow panthers.</p>

<h3 id="fey-panther">Fey Panther</h3>

<p>This is a Medium Fey Beast, and a Level 4 Skirmisher with 54 HP. It has trained
Perception and low-light vision, and moves with a ground speed of 8 and a climb
speed of 6.</p>

<p>The fey panther’s basic attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> that also allows it to shift 1
square on a hit. Its <strong>Charging Pounce</strong> ability allows it to deal extra damage
and knock the target prone on a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, it can also use <strong>fey step</strong> like an eladrin, teleporting 5 squares
once per encounter.</p>

<p>These abilities add up to a fighting style where the panther tries its best to
not stay engaged with a single target, using the shifts from its basic attack
and the teleport from Fey Step to make sure it’s always in position to charge
someone without receiving opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>If you really want a mundane panther, you could remove Fey Step from this one
and maybe lower its level to 3.</p>

<h3 id="spectral-panther">Spectral Panther</h3>

<p>Real-world black panthers are jaguars with a specific gene that makes them all
black. D&amp;D black panthers come from the Shadowfell!</p>

<p>Spectral panthers are Medium Shadow Beasts, and Level 9 Lurkers with 76 HP. They
run at speed 7, and oddly seem to lack a climb speed. They have trained
Perception and low-light vision.</p>

<p>Their name comes from the ability to assume a <strong>Spectral Form</strong> as a standard
action, which turns them insubstantial and gives them a +5 bonus to Stealth
(bringing the total up to +19), but makes their attacks deal half damage. Once
in this form, they can use another standard action to turn <strong>Invisible</strong>. Both
conditions can be ended as a free action, and invisibility also ends when the
panther makes an attack.</p>

<p>They attack with their <strong>Claws</strong>, and when an enemy moves or shifts into an
adjacent square they can also use a <strong>Tail Spike</strong> as a reaction. Both attacks
deal extra damage if the panther has Combat Advantage against the target.</p>

<p>Overall, the spectral panther is slightly sub-par as a lurker, because it takes
two turns to become invisible and the combat advantage bonus damage isn’t big
enough to make up for that. You’re probably better off sticking to
insubstantiality for repositioning, and relying on flanking and such to get
combat advantage. Or you could change <strong>Spectral Form</strong> so it makes the panther
invisible right away.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a single sample encounter here, along with the usual statement that lots
of intelligent humanoids end up keeping supernatural panthers as pets and attack
animals.</p>

<p>The encounter is level 9: 2 spectral panthers, a dark stalker, and a pair of
shadar-kai warriors.</p>

<p>Panthers are… okay, I guess. Their existence is a cool bit of color, but they
don’t make immediately want to use them in an encounter like other monsters here
did.</p>

<p>Owlbears have been in the game since at least BECMI, and likely since the
beginning. As another rather popular and iconic monster, they are both in the
Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Owlbears are dangerous predators that originated in the Feywild but spread to
the world ages ago. They have the strength of a bear, the cunning of an owl, and
are always hungry.</p>

<p>The creature’s owl bits give it excellent night vision, better talons than what
you usually find in a bear, and a characteristic hooting call. Their fey nature
also means they have magic powers, which can vary with their specific
environment but always include something related to their hoots. Owlbears get
together to mate and rear their cubs, usually only sticking around only long
enough to accomplish that. If prey is plentiful, they might stay together
longer.</p>

<p>Any creature that crosses an owlbear’s territory is fair game. Some owlbears
drag the carcasses of their prey back to their lairs and hang the leftovers on
nearby trees and bushes in hopes of attracting scavengers who will serve as
future meals.</p>

<p>Owlbears are difficult, but not impossible to tame. All manner of fey, goblins,
and even giants might take them as guards, attack animals, or simply pets. In
fact, with the Fey Beast Tamer theme introduced in the guide to the Feywild, PCs
can also have their own pet owlbears!</p>

<p>Some of the fey skip all the boring animal handling work and use charm spells -
it’s the GM’s call whether that’s a prudent thing to do.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Owlbears are Fey Beasts with average Int score of 2. They have a ground speed of
7, low-light vision with trained Perception. Their attacks are usually with
their claws and beaks, though each variety has a different magic
hoot/screech/call as well.</p>

<p>The MM varieties, as usual, need a damage update.</p>

<h3 id="owlbear">Owlbear</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212 HP and size Large. Its basic
attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong>, and it can make two of those per standard
action. If both hit, the target is grabbed (escape DC 19 for Acrobatics or 22
for Athlethics).</p>

<p>The owlbear can <strong>Bite</strong> a grabbed target, hitting automatically for enough
damage that even without an update it’s close to what it should be for a limited
attack. It’s a standard action but it’s definitely worth it.</p>

<p>When first bloodied it will emit a <strong>Stunning Screech</strong> as a free action. This
is a Close Burst 1 vs Fortitude which does no damage but stuns on a hit (save
ends). Don’t cluster around it!</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This Huge owlbear is likely adapted to live in regions of supernatural winter in
the Feywild. Instead of relying on pure physical power, it uses innate ice
magic. It’s a Level 14 Elite Controller with 280 HP.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Winterclaw</strong> that does a mix of physical and cold
damage, and slows on a hit (save ends). It can make two of those per standard
action, and if both hit the target is immobilized (save ends) with a slow
aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<p>Its magic call trick is the <strong>Frost Wail</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), which
does cold damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when the owlbear is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>With a winterclaw owlbear you’ll want to keep everyone immobilized and
preferably isolated, allowing the other monsters in the encounter to pick the
PCs off one by one.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The main difference from the Monster Manual here is that the owlbear’s low-light
vision has been upgraded to full Darkvision. They also have properly updated
damage.</p>

<h3 id="young-owlbear">Young Owlbear</h3>

<p>Essentially a non-elite version of the basic Owlbear, it’s a Level 8 Brute with
106 HP. It fights in exactly the same way, and even has the ability to make two
attacks per turn and grab if both hit.</p>

<p>Its hoot only dazes instead of stunning (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="owlbear-1">Owlbear</h2>

<p>A straightforward update of the MM version. Still a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212
HP, its damage has been updated but no other changes were made.</p>

<h2 id="trained-owlbear">Trained Owlbear</h2>

<p>This Large owlbear likely represents a beast that has been tamed and trained
since hatching. It lacks that primal vigor of the wild variety but has better
teamwork.</p>

<p>Trained owlbears are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They mostly fight with Reach 2
<strong>Claws</strong> but have a few other tricks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Thunderous Shrieks</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) do
thunder damage and knock prone on a hit. If an adjacent enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t include the owlbear as a target, it will use a <strong>Guardian Claw</strong> to
attack them as an opportunity action. This deals the same damage as a basic
attack, or a flat 5 damage on a miss.</p>

<p>So these owlbears will run right into the fray and occupy the attention of the
enemy front-line, while their masters further back use magic or ranged
attacks. Pretty straightforward soldier types, though they’ll keep some space
between themselves to avoid friendly fire with the thunder shrieks.</p>

<h2 id="wind-claw-owlbear">Wind-Claw Owlbear</h2>

<p>Likely a subspecies that’s adapted to living in windy mountain passes or similar
environments. They’re Level 11 Elite Controllers with 228 HP.</p>

<p>Wind-claws are surrounded by a <strong>Keening Gale</strong> aura 2 that causes any enemies
ending their turn inside to take 5 damage, and allows the owlbear to slide them
2 squares.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Wind Claws</strong> do physical damage, slide the target 2 squares, and knock
it prone. On a miss the owlbear can still slide the target 1 square.</p>

<p>The ability that lets them attack twice is named <strong>Disembowel</strong> (it’s just
“Double Attack” for everyone else). If both attacks hit, the target is stunned
for a turn. I suppose this would be a literal disemboweling if the target hits 0
HP, otherwise they’re just momentarily stunned at narrowling escaping a
disemboweling.</p>

<p>This owlbear also has a <strong>Beak Snap</strong> that hits a grabbed target automatically,
but it lacks any abilities that grab the target! You can either add this ability
to one of its existing attacks, or use the default Grab attack everyone gets
(vs. Reflex, a hit does no damage but grabs the target).</p>

<p>When the owlbear is first bloodied, it lets loose a <strong>Wind Howl</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude). A hit does no damage, but pushes the targets 3 squares and
knocks them prone. A miss still pushes them 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear-1">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This is a straightforward update of the MM Winterclaw Owlbear, with the same
level, the same abilities, and updated damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 owlbear, and a trio of satyrs. These would definitely go the “charm
spell” route for taming the owlbear.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 winterclaw owlbear and 3 cyclopes. These would tame them through
unceasing toil, for that is the cyclops way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love owlbears! Like otyughs, they’re one of those monsters that are a sure
sign that you’re in a D&amp;D world as opposed to some other fantasy setting. And
sure, they’re dangerous predators in-setting, but there’s something extremely
funny and even cute about the concept of a bear with an owl’s head that goes
“who?”.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they seem to do their job so well that the Monster Vault didn’t
change the original stat blocks at all aside from the damage update.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Otyughs have been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and are probably
the game’s most unintentionally iconic monster. Fourth Edition leans into this
iconic status and features them in both the Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Otyughs are large, strange-looking beasts who feed on rotten organic
matter. They love to hang out in dark places where such matter is plentiful,
like fetid swamps, middens, sewers, mass graves, and so on. I think some
editions make them sapient, but here they’re mostly just animals.</p>

<p>These beasts behave like ambush scavengers, something which you don’t find often
in the real world. They bury themselves in mounds of filth, or submerge
themselves in pools of tainted water and such. Their central tentacle contains
their eyes and nostrils, so they use it to peek at their surroundings. They
strike with their other two clawed tentacles at any unlucky creatures that pass
by, kill them, and add them to the pile to wait until their flesh is rotten and
good for eating. They will also eat whatever rot was already there, of course.</p>

<p>You can’t really tame an otyugh, but lots of people use them as natural garbage
disposals because if you put them in your middens or sewers they’ll happily stay
there. Less scrupulous people also use them as security systems, since they’ll
attack any smartass adventurers who think they can invade your dungeon through
its sewers.</p>

<p>There’s a small danger here, which is that if an otyugh’s trash pile doesn’t get
renewed fast enough the thing will wander off in search of another. I imagine
this isn’t a problem for a sewer in active use, but an “artificial” pile meant
to house a guardian otyugh would need maintenance.</p>

<p>Otyughs aren’t very fast, but their brown mottled hides are excellent camouflage
for their chosen habitat, their tentacles are strong and dangerous and, well,
they smell like shit. It’s hard to handle a sword when you’re trying to hold
your lunch in.</p>

<p>They also have a propensity to mutate, acquiring a coloration and perhaps other
properties in line with its specific chosen environment. This makes them
suceptible to external mutating energies as well, such as those of the Far Realm
(or a Cocaine Wizard’s privy).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM only has one <strong>Otyugh</strong> stat block. It’s a Large Natural Beast, and a
Level 7 Soldier with 82 HP. It has Darkvision and trained Perception, a land
speed of 5 and a swim speed of 5. It’s immune to disease, and it pretty much has
to be.</p>

<p>Otyughs are also trained in Stealth, and have a trait called <strong>Spying Eye</strong> for
the eye-tentacle trick described in the Lore section which gives them a +10
bonus to Stealth when immersed in filth. This elevates its total bonus to +18,
making it challenging to spot even for the party radar at equivalent levels.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Otyugh Stench</strong> is an aura 1 that inflicts a -2 attack penalty on any
living enemies inside. It will mostly attack with its <strong>Tentacles</strong>, which are
Reach 3, pull the target 2 squares and grab on a hit in addition to doing
damage. By MM rules, the escape DC is 22 for Athletics and 16 for Acrobatics,
due to the large disparity between the otyugh’s Fortitude and Reflexes.</p>

<p>Against adjacent targets the creature can use its <strong>Diseased Bite</strong>, which deals
a little more damage than the tentacle and cause the target to contract filth
fever.</p>

<p>This is standard Filth Fever, not a specific variant. It’s a level 3 disease
whose Improve and Maintain DCs are 16 and 11. Stage 1 eats a healing
surge. Stage 2 adds a -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude, and Reflex. Stage 3 keeps
the penalty, eats all of your healing surges and prevents you from recovering
hit points.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where the first stage is an annoyance, but you really
<em>don’t</em> want to let the disease progress to stage 3 (also known as “sepsis”).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>We have three otyughs here, extending their viability as threats into the early
paragon tier. In the Monster Vault rules, disease transmission isn’t
automatic. You need to make a save after a fight in which you were exposed, and
only contract the disease if you fail.</p>

<h3 id="otyugh">Otyugh</h3>

<p>This one is an update of the MM Otyugh. Still a level 7 soldier with 82 HP, it
fights in much the same way. I’ll note the differences.</p>

<p>The damage from all of its attacks has been updated. The <strong>tentacles</strong> have a
fixed escape DC of 16, and the <strong>diseased bite</strong> deals extra damage against
grappled targets. Spying Eye is gone as a separate trait, though the creature’s
Stealth bonus of +13 means it does still get a boost here.</p>

<p>The bite’s disease is named Lesser Otyugh Filth Fever and has the exact same
stats despite being level 7. I guess the level 3 in the MM was a typo. Its text
does clarify that when you reach Stage 3, you can no longer make Endurance tests
to recover naturally.</p>

<h3 id="charnel-otyugh">Charnel Otyugh</h3>

<p>A specimen that likely spent too long hanging out in cemeteries or
battlefields. Or maybe the pet of some lich or vampire. Still a Large Natural
Beast, this one is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with 212 HP and a host of necrotic
powers.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stench</strong> is still here, with identical effects. Its basic tentacle attack
is the <strong>Charnel Lash</strong>, which works like the standard otyugh tentacle attack
with an escape DC of 18 and ongoing necrotic damage on top of the other effects
(save ends).</p>

<p>The charnel otyugh can use <strong>Life Leech</strong> against a grabbed target, a
minor-action attack against Fortitude that deals 10 necrotic damage and heals
the monster for 5 HP on a hit.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Rotting Bite</strong> also has an ongoing necrotic damage rider, and transmits
Greater Otyugh Filth Fever, a level 11 version of the disease with an Improve DC
of 19 and a Maintain DC of 13. Its effects are the same otherwise.</p>

<p>The monster can also flail its tentacles around in a <strong>Charnel Frenzy</strong> (Close
Burst 3; recharge 5-6) dealing a bit less damage than the basic attack but still
inflicting ongoing necrotic damage.</p>

<h3 id="neo-otyugh">Neo-Otyugh</h3>

<p>An otyugh mutated by the Far Realm, either from being exposed to a rift or from
eating aberrant creatures. Unlike its lesser relatives it’s a Huge Aberrant
Magical Beast, meaning its sapient! Its Int is 7, making it as smart as a hill
giant.</p>

<p>Neo-Otyughs are Level 11 Elite Controllers with 232 HP. Their land and swim
speeds go up to 7 from the usual 5. Their <strong>Stench</strong> is an aura 2 with the same
effects, and they also have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong>.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Tentacles</strong> are Reach 4, and aside from the usual damage a hit pulls 3
squares and grabs (DC 19). The usual bite has been upgraded to a <strong>Massive Maw
of Decay</strong> (close blast 2)! It does physical damage plus ongoing necrotic
damage, and exposes anyone hit to Greater Otyugh Filth Fever. It also does
extra damage against grabbed targets.</p>

<p>As if this wasn’t enough, Neo-Otyughs have psychic powers. <strong>Disgusting Lure</strong>
(Ranged 20 vs. Will) is a minor-action attack that does a bit of psychic damage
and a larger amount if the target doesn’t end their next turn adjacent to the
Otyugh.</p>

<p>The neo-otyugh can also used a grabbed victim as a <strong>Body Shield</strong> when hit by
an attack. This isn’t automatic, and requires an attack against the grabbed
victim’s Fortitude. On a success, the attack hits the victim instead of the
monster.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two in the MM, exemplifying the two most common otyugh fight scenarios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 otyugh and an assortment of troglodytes. The trogs use the otyugh
as a garbage disposal and will try to push meddlesome adventurers towards it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 2 otyughs and 2 carrion crawlers. Carrion crawlers are opportunists
and will often hang around otyughs to steal their kills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As I said back in the introduction, to me Otyughs are an iconic part of D&amp;D. If
I see an otyugh in a story of any type, I know it’s not just a fantasy story,
but specifically a D&amp;D one. So while I don’t exactly find them cool, I like them
in that capacity.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Orcus has been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and is the strongest
monster in the 4e Monster Manual. He is not in the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Orcus is the known by many titles, such as the Prince of Undead, Demon Lord of
Undeath, and Blood Lord. He’s a Demon Lord, which is not a formal title but a
terse way of saying Orcus is one of the strongest demons in all of the Abyss,
powerful enough to challenge the gods. Orcus wants to destroy the gods
themselves, particularly the Raven Queen so he can usurp her dominion over
Death.</p>

<p>Orcus hates all life to an even greater extent than your average demon. He can’t
stand to be near anything living, and even his demon servitors are undead. His
domain is named Thanatos and covers an entire layer of the Abyss, being
predictably composed of an endless sucession of mausoleums, graveyards, dismal
moors, and other lifeless corpse-filled places. I’m guessing that where the
Shadowfell is moody gothic poetry, Thanatos is death metal.</p>

<p>The demon lord himself seems to be stuck somewhere between life and undeath, as
his corpulent form seems either alive but diseased, or undead depending on which
parts you look at. He wields a heavy mace with a haft of ruby-studded obsidian
and a head made from a gigantic skull, a weapon known as the <em>wand of
Orcus</em>. There are multiple stories about the origin of the skull. Some say it
belonged to a noble and just god, others to a mortal hero (in which case it was
magically enlarged). In either case there is nothing of that person’s good left
inside. Those killed by the Wand rise as undead loyal to Orcus.</p>

<p>Orcus’s main stronghold is Everlost, an obsidian palace at the center of
Thanatos built over a bottomless chasm whose walls are completely covered in
crypts and mausoleums. He also shares the layer with his Exarchs, lieutenants
imbued with a shard of his power. One example is Dorensain the Ghoul King, who
presides over ghouls and cannibalism and lives in a section of Thanatos named
the White Kingdom (because it’s entirely made of bones).</p>

<p>There are many cults to Orcus in the world, whose membership consists of people
who want to be “rewarded” with undeath, or who want to kill the world for other
reasons. These cults tend to be a lot subtler than those of Yeenoghu or
Baphomet, who also got name-checked in this book. They gather in secret in
places like graveyards, and do things like human sacrifice, blood-drinking, and
covertly spreading disease. They don’t see undeath itself as holy, but as a tool
to help with the goal of extinguishing all life. Every cultist aims to become
some kind of powerful undead like a royal mummy, death knight, vampire, or
lich. Most don’t manage, of course, but they consider even being turned into a
skeleton or zombie after death to be a good service to their demon master.</p>

<p>The most powerful among Orcus’ priesthood are given the knowledge to summon as
Aspect of Orcus, a miniature version of the demon lord himself created from his
power. Aspects have no mental link of any kind to the original, though they have
the same personality. They usually disappear when the task for which they were
conjured is done.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>This entry has a lot of related stat blocks, and we’ll look at them in order of
level.</p>

<h3 id="crimson-acolyte">Crimson Acolyte</h3>

<p>Any of the stat blocks we already saw for humans or others could work as a
cultist, but this one has some Orcus-specific flavor. Crimson acolytes are
humans, and therefore Medium Natural Humanoids. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers with
76 HP. They wear leather armor.</p>

<p>The acolyte wields a <strong>scythe</strong> in combat, which does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage and has a +2 attack bonus against bloodied targets. It also
marks them as a total edgelord.</p>

<p>They also have an ability called <strong>Crimson Path</strong>, an at-will minor action that
allows them to shift 1 square (2 when bloodied).</p>

<p>Their tactics are simple: use Crimson Path to get into flanking positions and
scythe away, preferring bloodied characters as targets. The scythe’s damage is
only 3 points short of where it should be, so fixing it is easy.</p>

<h3 id="deathpriest-of-orcus">Deathpriest of Orcus</h3>

<p>Deathpriests are Medium Natural Humanoids (usually humans) and Level 9
Controllers (Leaders) with 96 HP. They wear mail, and have speed 5. They also
project an aura called <strong>Death’s Embrace</strong>, which has a radius of 10 and
inflicts a -2 penalty to any death saves that happen inside.</p>

<p>Deathpriests start fighting at range using <strong>Rays of Black Fire</strong> (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that do fire and necrotic damage and grant an ally in sight a +2
bonus to its next attack. They really want to get right into the fray, though,
so that they can use their <strong>Dark Blessing</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs Fortitude). This
does necrotic damage and pushes all enemies caught in the burst 1 square, and
gives all allies a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the encounter. After they
spend their blessing, they’ll use <strong>mace</strong> attacks that do a mix of physical and
necrotic damage, or retreat and go back to using their rays.</p>

<p>The deathpriest’s damage is a full 9 points less than it should be, and really
needs a fix.</p>

<h3 id="deathprest-hierophant">Deathprest Hierophant</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-deathpriest.png"/>

</figure>

<p>This is likely Orcus’ most powerful living agent in any given campaign world,
and well on the way to becoming a lich or something equivalent. It’s a Level 21
Elite Controller with 382 HP.</p>

<p>The hierophant projects an <strong>Aura of Decay</strong> out to 5 squares, which inflicts -2
to all defenses on any living enemies inside. At the time of writing this was
the same as saying “all enemies”, but by the end of 4e we had like three
different ways of making PC vampires, so they’d be immune.</p>

<p>The hierophant’s most powerful attack is <strong>Word of Orcus</strong> (close burst 5
vs. Fortitude; recharge 6), which does necrotic damage and stuns (save
ends). Any undead allies in the burst also regain 15 HP. If that’s not charged,
there’s the <strong>Word of Death</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge 4-6) which does
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). And if neither is charged there’s the good
old <strong>mace</strong> which does physical damage and ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The frequent dazes and stuns are pretty dangerous, but the hierophant’s damage
is a full 20 points behind where it should be for all attacks except for the
mace, which is “just” 10 points behind.</p>

<h3 id="aspect-of-orcus">Aspect of Orcus</h3>

<p>The Aspect of Orcus is a Large Elemental Humanoid (Demon), and a Level 24 Elite
Brute with 560 HP. It has darkvision and trained Perception. It’s immune to
poison and disease, has 20 necrotic resistance, and 10 variable resistance that
it can switch 3 times per encounter. It runs at speed 6 or flies at speed 8
(clumsy).</p>

<p>The Aspect projects a <strong>Lesser Aura of Death</strong> out to 10 squares. Enemies caught
inside take 5 necrotic damage, or 10 if the Aspect is bloodied. It fights with a
<strong>Skull Mace</strong> that’s likely a lesser copy of the Wand: a hit deals a
disappointing amount of physical damage and weakens (save ends).</p>

<p>More dangerous is the <strong>Tail Lash</strong> the Aspect can use on any enemy that moves
or shifts to a square adjacent to it, as a reaction. This does a bit more damage
than the mace, and knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>After all the hype in the lore section, I find the Aspect of Orcus to be a bit
of a disappointment. I imagine it works well as a “Summon” when backed up by a
hierophant and high-level undead. If Orcus himself sends out a lieutenant to do
his work, though, he’s going to send a balor, an atropal, or Dorensain.</p>

<p>If you plan to use the Aspect, fixing its damage is crucial, as it’s 25 points
smaller than it should be.</p>

<h3 id="dorensain-exarch-of-orcus">Dorensain, Exarch of Orcus</h3>

<p>The Ghoul King looks like, well, a ghoul, but one that walks upright and is
dressed in what passes for elegant finery in his kingdom: a coat made of human
flesh over leather armor that’s also surely made from people. A crown of bones
rests on his head, and he wields a staff named Toothlust, made from somebody’s
spine and teeth.</p>

<p>Dorensain is a Medium Natural Humanoid (Undead) and a Level 27 Elite Skirmisher
with 508 HP. He has super-high Initiative, trained Perception, and
darkvision. Like the Aspect above, he’s immune to disease and poison and has 20
necrotic resistance. He also has 10 radiant vulnerability. He runs at speed 8.</p>

<p>He fights with <strong>Toothlust</strong> in combat, and the bites of that weapon deal
immediate and ongoing physical damage (save ends). That fine coat is the <strong>Cloak
of Mouths</strong>, whose bites do physical damage and slow (save ends). You know
you’re looking at a sophisticated ghoul when he uses utensils to eat you.</p>

<p>Dorensain can sometimes pull off a <strong>Ravenous Frenzy</strong> maneuver (recharge 6),
which allows him to move his speed without provoking opportunity attacks and
make a Cloak of Mouths attack on anyone he passes by. He can also teleport 12
squares as a move action (recharge 4-6).</p>

<p>The Ghoul King is difficult to pin down, and apparently good at keeping his
enemies slowed and vulnerable to whatever honor guard he travels with.</p>

<h3 id="orcus">Orcus</h3>

<p>The Big Goat Cheese himself is a Gargantuan Elemental Humanoid (Demon) and a
Level 33 Solo Brute with 1525 HP! As I said above, he is the highest-level
monster in the entire Monster Manual.</p>

<p>As expected, he has darkvision and trained Perception. His ground speed is 6,
and he flies at speed 10 and teleports at speed 6, at-will. Orcus is immune to
disease, poison and <em>necrotic damage</em>, and has the usual demonic Variable
Resistance 10 (3/encounter). He is not particularly vulnerable to radiant
damage. And then there are the auras.</p>

<p>The first is the <strong>Aura of Death</strong>, which is 20 squares wide and deals 10
necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. This increases to 20 while Orcus is
bloodied.</p>

<p>The second is <strong>The Dead Rise</strong> (aura 6), which turns all covered squares into
difficult terrain for enemies, even flying ones! I guess it’s due to all the
grasping skeletal hands bursting out of the ground and tormented specters flying
around. Any dead creature inside, except those killed by the Wand of Orcus, rise
as abyssal ghoul myrmidons under Orcus’ control.</p>

<p>Why are creatures killed by the wand exempt from this? Because due to a little
trait called <strong>Master of Undeath</strong>, victims of the Wand rise as <em>dread wraiths</em>
at the start of Orcus’ next turn if they’re still dead by then.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wand of Orcus</strong> itself is not all that impressive. It’s Reach 4 and does a
mix of physical and necrotic damage on a hit. You should just about double its
damage to get it to expected levels.</p>

<p>A bit more dangerous are Orcus’ two recharge attacks. <strong>Necrotic Burst</strong> (close
burst 10 vs. Fortitude; recharge 6) is very accurate, does necrotic damage and
heals all undead allies for 20 HP. <strong>Touch of Death</strong> (Melee 4 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 6) is the big one: a hit reduces the target to 0 HP, bypassing any and
all resistances. A miss deals damage equal to the target’s bloodied value. A
couple of good whacks with the fixed Wand after hitting with this, and you
have a brand new dread wraith!</p>

<p>When an enemy moves or shifts to a square adjacent to Orcus, he can use a <strong>Tail
Lash</strong> as a reaction, doing a bit less damage than the wand, stunning the target
for a turn and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Orcus suffers a bit from same problems that plagued 3e boss monsters, which are
that he has few ranged options and is susceptible to a bunch of conditions that
limit his actions. Those are less of a problem than they would have been in 3e,
but you still might want to give him something like a dragon’s Action Recovery
ability.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a whole bunch!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 1 deathpriest, 4 crimson acolytes, 2 battle wights. Your typical
cult, with living and undead members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 hierophant, 5 abyssal ghoul myrmidons (minions), 2 rot harbingers,
1 rot slinger. The Hierophant and his honor guard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 hierophant, 3 blood fiends, 1 aspect of Orcus. An alternate
configuration, and yet another indication that blood fiends should really be
undead demons instead of abominations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 28: Dorensain, 2 dread wraiths, 2 epic liches, and 10 abyssal ghoul
myrmidons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 34: Orcus, 2 atropals, and 8 lich vestiges. What, you thought the big
solo was going to fight alone?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Orcus and his related monsters suffer from a lot of the problems endemic to
the early Monster Manual, with the epic stat blocks getting hit the hardest as
usual. However, those are all eminently fixable.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about this whole entry is that it’s here at all! My impression
with AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, and with 3.x, was that they viewed threats of this
caliber as something the PCs weren’t expected to fight and win. They either had
no stats, or they had overpowered numbers calculated to be beyond the reach of
even the most powerful group. This impression is probably also colored by my
memories of the largely oppressive and adversarial nature of the DMs of the
time.</p>

<p>Orcus is, well, still quite powerful, but in a way that’s supposed to make him a
suitable “last boss” for a campaign. Sure, he has an attack that reduces people
to 0 HP and powers that turn dead characters into epic undead under his
command… but epic PCs are demigods who can resurrect once per day on their
own, and epic leader PCs are up to the challenge of keeping their buddies from
dying at all. In fact the Big O might actually need a little boost to prevent
stun-locking by those epic characters.</p>

<p>Mechanical details aside, this feels right. If I manage to reach level 30 in a
campaign, I want to end it with a bang by taking out one of the big name
canonical demon lords. And when the next campaign starts, I want them to <em>stay
dead</em>.</p>
