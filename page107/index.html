          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Doing “year in review” posts seems to be the thing to do, so I’ll write one as
well. This post started out as an overall overview of my 2016 tabletop gaming,
but that turned out to be mostly about GURPS anyway, so I’m categorizing it as a
GURPS post.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-blog">State of the Blog</h2>

<p>The big news here is that I started a blog! You’re looking at it! Octopus
Carnival is a little over three months old at this point: its first post went up
in September 27th, 2016. Let’s talk a bit about how it’s been doing.</p>

<p>I’ve been keeping track of how many visitors and views I get using Google
Analytics, purely for my own enjoyment as I’ve pledged to myself I wouldn’t
include adds or affiliate links here. The following comments about my traffic
all refer from the data registered in Analytics.</p>

<p>During the first month I managed to publish a post every day, making progress in
two still ongoing projects: an adaptation of Dragon’s Dogma to GURPS, and GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy versions of the Pathfinder Iconic characters. Whenever a new
post came up I posted announcements
to <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=146235">a thread in the Steve Jackson Games forum</a> and <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?791116-Blog-Octopus-Carnival-RPG-Posts">a thread on RPG.net</a>,
and after a while I started posting to a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114152615291904398040">GURPS community in Google Plus</a> and
to the [GURPS Discord  as well.</p>

<p>From October 26th to November 13th I was out of the country and didn’t have time
to post anything, which meant my carefully cultivated traffic fell to nearly
zero and I had to start over. My posting rate for gameable content isn’t quite
up to what it was before that trip, but that’s intentional: it was kinda eating
into the rest of my life. I still hope to post 2-3 times a week from now on.</p>

<p>Direct access seems to be the main source of traffic to the site, sitting at 21%
of the total. I imagine that’s not just people typing up the URL in their
browsers, tough that’s certainly part of it. Links that don’t contain a referrer
would also count towards this total, and a good bit of those are likely to be
people following internal links between posts.</p>

<p>The second largest source overall, and the main source of <em>referral</em> traffic is
the SJ Games forum threa, accounting for 20% or all sessions. Google Plus comes
in third overall. <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/">Gaming Ballistic’s GURPS Day posts</a> came in at fourth
until very recently, but were just edged out by an interesting phenomenom.</p>

<p>Looks like a couple of my posts were linked at a pair of Russian social
networks/blog sites, <a href="http://imaginaria.ru/">imaginaria.ru</a> and vk.com, and they got some attention from
Russian roleplayers. That’s something I never thought would happen, and it makes
me happy!</p>

<p>Most of those accesses seem to be to the Octopus Carnival home page, which means
a lot of people just go there to read the latest post. As for the individual
posts, the most popular ones are the Pathfinder characters, despite those only
technically being a side project. I can’t say I’m surprised that the Pathfinder
name draws eyeballs even on a blog with not a single d20 rule on it. It’s a big
name! <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">Amiri the Barbarian</a> is the most popular of the converted iconics,
being both the first I posted and the one that got linked to those Russian
blogs. <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros the Fighter</a> comes just below her, having also been linked
there. <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra the Cleric</a> is third.</p>

<p>Of the Dragon’s Dogma posts, the most popular are the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knight</a>
and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a>, which makes me happy because I’m proud of how they
turned out.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy about how I’m doing! Octopus Carnival isn’t as popular
as some of the superstars in the GURPS blogging community, but it does have a
following and that’s a lot more than I expected :). So thank you for reading it!</p>

<p>For next year, I’ll try to diversify my subjects a bit more. I’m literally one
article away from finishing the main Pathfinder series, and I can already see
the end of the Dragon’s Dogma posts as well. There’s <em>plenty</em> of other stuff I
want to say on all sorts of RPG-related topics, so I won’t run out of material
anytime soon.</p>

<h2 id="actual-play">Actual Play</h2>

<p>Pretty much all of my actual roleplaying in this past year has happened online
and asynchronously. I’ve been GMing a Dungeon Fantasy play-by-forum game over on
RPG.net for quite a while now, and while players have come and gone I managed to
get a small but solid core of players who don’t mind the occasional posting
slowdown and are entertained enough by my dungeons and the humorous interactions
between their PCs. In 2016 this game has continued, and we just managed to
complete our third dungeon delve (and our second full adventure!).</p>

<p>I had also started a GURPS X-COM game back in 2015, and until recently we had
managed to complete several adventures as well and make good progress on the
overall campaign (which was planned in far greater detail than the
dungeon-of-the-week DF game). Unfortunately, the game ran out of steam around
November, and I ended it with a post-mortem rather than letting it whimper out
of existence.</p>

<p>I also participated in a few forum games as a player, though all but three of
them died the usual death of forum games. Two are still ongoing: one is
Godbound, the other a homebrew science fiction system. One was a Legend of the
Five Rings 4th edition adventure that concluded successfully, and which I still
remember fondly.</p>

<p>Most of my face-to-face gaming has been of the board game variety. I’ve gotten
plenty of use out of the XCOM board game, and played a bunch of stuff from my
friends’ vast collections.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly <em>dissatisfied</em> with the overall situation in this area, but I do
wish I could play a few RPG sessions at a pace closer to real time. And that’s
what I’ll try to do in 2017.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Thief, which means today’s character is Merisiel. Here
she is:</p>

</figure>

<p>Merisiel has all the knives. <em>All of them</em>. We’re back in familiar territory
with her, as she’s one of the Iconics from the core book. Her bio is <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la5z?Meet-the-Iconics-Merisiel">here</a>
and her stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/merisiel.html">here</a>. From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
hidden, to better backstab her foes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>.</p>

<p>First of all, she’s an elf, but <em>which type</em> of elf?  There’s like a hundred of
them in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy 3</strong>. Pathfinder’s stats for elves would suggest the
High Elf racial template is appropriate. That’s not all, however! Merisiel is a
<em>Forlorn</em> elf, which means she grew up among humans and had no contact with
elven culture to speak of. And the <strong>DF 3</strong> elf template that best models that
is the <em>Half</em>-Elf, even down to the problems relating to both humans and
elves. Theoretically full-blooded elves would have longer lifespans and such,
but that’s not worth any points in a <strong>DF</strong> campaign.</p>

<p>The other challenge is finding the appropriate template for her. The Thief
template from <strong>DF 1</strong> is a lot closer to the Thief class from early D&amp;D - a
middling combatant who’s great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult
places. The d20 Rogue class is still good at those non-combat things, but its
main focus is stabbing monsters for massive damage. This is why Merisiel’s
Pathfinder stats give her a rapier despite her bio’s focus on knives - it’s the
best melee weapon for rogues in that system. I’m going to use the Thief template
here, since it’s the whole point of this post, but I don’t want to leave the
stabbing part entirely out. Fortunately, the list of Thief Power-Ups in <strong>DF
11</strong> gives us something to remedy that.</p>

<p>Our version of Merisiel is quite sharper than her original bio indicates, though
I suppose it wouldn’t be apparent to someone who witnessed her failing two or
more simultaneous self-control rolls. Both her DX and IQ are one point lower
than you would expect for someone with these templates, to make room for the
stabby (Weapon Master for all sorts of knives and Backstabber). The reduced IQ
hurts some of her thief skills, but we make up for that with an extra level of
Manual Dexterity (which also affects DX-based rolls for Traps and Lockpicking).</p>

<p>Some future upgrades that look particularly appropriate are more levels of
Backstabber and Night Vision. As a member of one <strong>DF</strong>’s “skill monkey”
templates, she can also benefit from increases to all of her skills,
particularly Main-Gauche (which is a bit low for a weapon master) and the mental
skills hurt by the IQ reduction. Actually buying that “lost” point of IQ would
be a worthwhile investment, as would the Thief-specific Talents from <strong>DF 11</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the fourth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

</ul>

<p>Saurians are the least populous of the three sapient species inhabiting the
Gransys peninsula. They are less technically sophisticated than humans but
require little in the way of tools due to their great strength and
hardiness. And while they’re not nearly as malicious as goblins, they’re
fiercely territorial and have no qualms about eating any trespassers.</p>

<p>A Saurian’s body is densely muscled and covered in scales similar to a
crocodile’s in texture. Their heads resemble those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona">bearded dragons</a>, and
their mouths are filled with sharp teeth. A Saurian is able to walk upright not
just because of its roughly humanoid limbs, but because of its thick tail that
acts as a counterweight and shifts its center of mass backwards. The final
result makes even a burly human warrior look rather puny.</p>

<p>Saurians live in small bands humans call “basks” for their tendency to be found
basking in the sun. They reproduce by laying large eggs with soft, slimy
shells that require constaint moisture, which means basks often claim territory
near large bodies of water.</p>

<p>Saurians fight using crude spears and polearms sized for their large
frames. These and the occasional rawhide satchel are the most sophisticated
tools any human has seen them use. Those experienced in fighting them know to
sever the tail: it can be targeted from the side or behind at a -2 penalty. Like
the tail of certain mundane lizards, it comes off easily: injury over HP/2 is
enough to sever it, which means the Saurian is unable to stand upright. This
doesn’t reduce its movement, but it <em>does</em> mean it can only use its natural
weapons to fight.</p>

<p>Saurians in this state will usually try to flee the battle. The tail grows back
in time even if severed!</p>

<p>Below are descriptions of all species of saurian found in the original game and
its expansion. They are meant to be worthy challenges to 250-point delvers,
which makes them quite scary for less powerful characters.</p>

<h2 id="common-saurian">Common Saurian</h2>

<p>The most commonly found variety of Saurian is a dark brownish green in color,
and conforms exactly to the general description above. They are cold-blooded,
and thus tend to keep to Gransys’ warmer southern reaches.</p>

<p>In the original game, there was a sizable group of them living in a flooded
seaside cave underneath Cassardis, complete with a large amount of eggs.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+4 imp or 2d+4 cut, Reach 1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+1 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); DR 4 (Tough Skin); Peripheral Vision;
Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain Adaptation (Swamp);
Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="sulfur-saurian">Sulfur Saurian</h2>

<p>This species of Saurian is so named for the color of their scales, which are
black with bright yellow streaks. They are a little more tolerant of the cold
than Common Saurians, and thus live further north. They share the same general
traits described above, and possess two other remarkable abilities: they can
shift the color of their scales to match their surroundings, and they can spit
paralytic venom!</p>

<p>Basks of Sulfur Saurians are common on the margins of the river crossing the
Cursewood in central Gransys and on the warm waters of Lake Hardship, being one
of the reasons for the lake’s name.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 17; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+5 imp or 2d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*. Often laced with the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d+1 cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF
3</strong>, p. 15) and from the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Poison Spit (12)</strong>: HT to resist; failure entails a non-cumulative -3 to DX
and IQ for 1 hour. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Chameleon 4; DR 4 (Tough Skin);
Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain
Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 1; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="geo-saurian">Geo Saurian</h2>

<p>This species has even stronger than a normal saurian, and has more clearly
supernatural traits. Their scales are black with small red streaks, and have a
metallic cast to them. Like sulfur saurians, they can change their coloration to
match the environment and have dangerous spit. Unlike sulfur saurians, their
sticky spit is <em>flaming</em>, not poisonous.</p>

<p>Geo Saurians can only be found on volcanic mountains or near active geothermal
vents. The most well-known concentration of these features is the Tainted
Mountain, which lies in the monster-infested range west of Gransys’s
borders. That’s not to say they couldn’t be found within some deep dungeon that
also had these features, along with other fire-themed beasts!</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 12U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 7 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 2d+3 imp or 3d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 2d-2 cut with linked 1d burning. The bite benefits from
<em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>, p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Flaming Spit (12)</strong>: 1d burning. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 2d cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Combat Reflexes; Chameleon 4; DR 7 (Tough
Skin); Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp);
Terrain Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="saurian-variants">Saurian Variants</h2>

<p>In all cases, the stat blocks above are for <em>average</em> saurians of each
type. The GM is free to increase their skills and attributes to produce
exceptional individuals without any additional justification! A few possible
variants found in the game merit special mention.</p>

<h3 id="giant-saurians">Giant Saurians</h3>

<p>Some saurians reach absurd sizes! Maybe they just never stop growing, or maybe
these have been contaminated by ambient magical energies. Take a normal saurian
and increase its SM to +2; multiply ST by 1.5. Their even bigger weapons add +1
to damage on top of the ST increase. Truly colossal specimens at SM+3, ST x2 and
+2 weapon damage might exist if the GM is feeling particularly sadistic.</p>

<h3 id="pyre-saurians">Pyre Saurians</h3>

<p>Despite their shape, they are not actual saurians, but lizard-shaped elemental
beings of pure fire and magma. Start with the stats for a geo saurian and change
its class to Elemental. Add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), +2d to the burning
damage from the bite and spit, and a 1d burning emanation in a 2 meter
radius. Fortunately, they use no weapons and always rely on their natural
claws, bite and tail.</p>

<h3 id="saurian-sages">Saurian Sages</h3>

<p>Despite their bestial nature, Saurians do have a mystical tradition centered
around mastering their vulnerability to cold. Those rare individuals who
complete a pilgrimage to the roots of the world are able to master cold itself!
To make a Saurian Sage, start with a normal saurian and remove
Cold-Blooded. Raise IQ to at least 12, and add three or more levels of Water
College Magery or Elemental Empowerment related to water. Give them any
appropriate ice-themed spells or elementalist powers you wish. If starting from
a geo saurian, their burning spit becomes freezing instead: it still does
burning damage, but it’s no longer incendiary.</p>

<h3 id="variant-stacking">Variant Stacking</h3>

<p>“Pyre Saurian” and “Saurian Sage” are incompatible with each other. You won’t
even find individuals of both types working together! However, both variants
<em>are</em> compatible with the “Giant” upgrade, and combining them can give you
something not entirely unlike a dragon.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Swashbuckler, which means today’s character is
Jirelle. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Jirelle.jpg"/>

</figure>

<p>Even if you’re familiar with Pathfinder’s Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the “Advanced Class Guide” supplement. You can find her
bio <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg5a?Meet-the-Iconics-Jirelle">here</a>, and the only place where I could find her stats is inside <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">this
free package of premade iconic characters</a> that contains all of them.</p>

<p>From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
sunk her evil pirate’s mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
is returning them to the depths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
fencing skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out we have quite a bit more options when picking a template for
Jirelle than we did back when I first started writing this series! The recently
released <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers</strong> has <em>five</em>
different swashbuckler templates, each one with a slightly different focus! Now,
Jirelle’s piratical background might point to the Buccaneer, but her Pathfinder
stats are all about the flashy fencing with only a slight nod towards seafaring
skills. So it turns out that the default Swashbuckler template really is the
best choice here. We just have to make sure she knows how to sail.</p>

<p>I’m pretty satisfied with the result! <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> Jirelle has skill 20
with her rapier and skill 18 with her buckler, which enables some pretty cool
tricks. She also knows her way around a ship, and her Charisma helps boost her
social skills and Rapier Wit ability. Making her a better leader of men would be
a good use of earned character points, especially in parties that lack a more
dedicated social character. And of course, points spent on Rapier will never go
to waste!</p>

<p>Speaking of “points spent on Rapier”, this version of Jirelle spends one
character point on extra starting cash so she can afford the Edged Rapier.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Please go <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/06/enemies-overview.html">here</a> for links to all other posts in the
series.</p>

<p>Not even <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/14/goblins.html">goblins</a> are as annoying as the wolves of Gransys. The original
game’s suicidally aggressive monster AI combined with the move set of the “wolf”
monster family ensures that even basic wolves remain a nuisance long after
they’ve stopped being a threat. It doesn’t help that your pawns will helpfully
expound on anti-wolf tactics for even the easiest such encounter. Hopefully the
tabletop version will be a little better in that regard. This article covers all
sorts of canine enemies, but we start with the most basic of them all:</p>

<h2 id="wolves">Wolves</h2>

<p>The southern forests and mountain passes of Gransys are home to packs of large,
brownish wolves. Most of the time, they stay away from civilization and restrict
their hunting to other wild animals further down the food chain. A wolf pack
will only target livestock if no wild prey is available, and will only attack
people if they are utterly desperate. Unfortunately, both situations have become
more common ever since increased bandit and goblin presence in Southern Gransys
made game scarcer.</p>

<p>Use the Wolf stats from p. <strong>B458</strong> for average wolves, and the more powerful
Hound and Timber Wolf stats from <strong>DF 5</strong> p. 9 for large specimens (of which
there is at least one per pack encountered).</p>

<h2 id="dire-wolves">Dire Wolves</h2>

<p>The colder northern reaches of Gransys are home to a larger and more vicious
white-furred species of wolf. The <em>smallest</em> of them use the Hound template from
<strong>DF 5</strong>, and they frequently get up to the size shown in <strong>DF 2</strong>, p. 22. While
they mostly stick to wild prey deep in the woods, they are much more confident
about targetting livestock and humans who wander into their territory.</p>

<h2 id="wargs">Wargs</h2>

<p>These horrible creatures look like standard wolves from a distance, but closer
inspection will reveal their true natures. Wargs are <em>undead</em> wolves, with
rotted-through hides and infected bites. Forget any semblance of realistic
behavior here - they hang out in tombs and dungeons and prefer their meals to be
sapient and alive at the time of eating.</p>

<p>To make a warg, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Undead. Change DR to 4, add Injury Tolerance (Unliving), and add a 1d toxic
follow-up to their bite, resisted with HT-2.</p>

<h2 id="hell-hounds">Hell Hounds</h2>

<p><em>These</em> horrors are stirred up by the coming of the Dragon, and enter the world
through the same portal as it. They are even more untroubled my mundane
physiology than wargs: their blood boils, and they breathe fire at will.</p>

<p>To make a hell hound, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Demon. Change DR to 5 (15 vs. Fire), add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), and a
2d Burning Innate Attack with the Cone enhancement. The cone is three yards wide
at its widest. They can use this attack <em>at will</em>, and are happy to do so since
they don’t need to worry about friendly fire!</p>

<h2 id="wolves-hunt-in-packs">Wolves Hunt in Packs!</h2>

<p>All enemies described in this article fight in a similar way. The pack attempts
to surround the target, and some of the wolves will distract it with growls and
feints so that others can bite from unexpected angles. They usually know their
territory fairly well, and might try to herd a particularly mobile victim to a
spot they can’t run away from.</p>

<p>All “wolf”-like enemies should have the Wrestling skill even if that’s not
listed in their original stats, at a level equal to the highest of their
Brawling or DX. They like to use that to grab their targets with a bite and pull
them to the ground, enabling the rest of the pack to move in and gang up on the
victim.</p>
