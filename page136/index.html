<p>This is the second of the two Dragon’s Dogma-specific character templates I
promised. Like the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a>, it’s a 250-point template suitable for a
Dungeon Fantasy campaign, with additional notes on how they fit into the
Dragon’s Dogma campaign setting.</p>

<p>Note that this is not the same as the template presented in <strong>Pyramid
#3/13</strong>, despite having the same name. As explained <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/18/characters-part-3.html">earlier</a>, I’m staying
away from Imbuements in this setting. Of course, if you like the Pyramid Mystic
Knight better, don’t hesitate to use it instead! And if you want to use both
templates in the same game, please feel free to rename this one.</p>

<h2 id="the-mystic-knight">The Mystic Knight</h2>

<p>You are a master of war, equally versed in the arts of melee combat and
battlefield magic. Unlike the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a> you like to be right in the
middle of the fight, though you prefer to make the enemy come to you rather than
charge blindly into the fray. You fight like a knight (<strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 10) but can
also handle trickier foes with your wizardly spells.</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: ST 13 {30}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 12 {40}; HT 13 {30}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Damage 1d/2d-1; BL 16.9kg (17 lbs); HP 13; Will
12; Per 12; FP 13; Basic Speed 6.00 {-10}; Basic Move 6 {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Born War Leader 1 {5}; Magery 3 {35}; Weapon Channeling
{1}. • A further 20 points chosen from <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">Archmagic</a> abilities or ST +1 or
+2 {10/level}, DX +1 {20}, IQ +1 {20}, HT +1 or +2 {10 or 20}, HP +1 to +3
{2/level}, FP +1 to +5 {3/level}; Born War-Leader 2-4 {5/level}, Combat Reflexes
{15}, Enhanced Block 1 {5}, Enhanced Parry 1 (One Melee Weapon skill) {5},
Fearlessness {2/level}, Hard to Kill {2/level}, Hard to Subdue {2/level}, High
Pain Threshold {10}, Luck {15}, Magery 3-4 {10/level}, Mind Shield {4/level},
Rapid Healing {5}, Recovery {10}, Signature Gear {Varies}, Striking ST 1 or 2
{5/level}, or Weapon Bond {1}.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Hidden Lore (Demons, Magical Items, Magical Writings,
Spirits <em>or</em> Undead) <em>and</em> Occultism, both (A) IQ {2}-12; Thaumathology (VH)
IQ+1 {1}<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>-12. •<em>One</em> of Crossbow or Thrown Weapon (Axe/Mace <em>or</em> Spear),

</ol>

<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Spend 20 points on wizardly spells, which start at either (H) IQ+1
{1}-13 or (VH) IQ {1}-12 with the +3 from Magery. Alternatively, spend some of
those points in additional Archmagic abilities.</p>

<h3 id="customization-notes">Customization Notes.</h3>

<p>Much of the variation in this template comes from weapon and spell choice. All
Mystic Knights favor either spells that enhance their own abilities and weapons
(such as Flaming Weapon and Flaming Armor), deliver DR-ignoring damage that they
can channel through their weapons or shields (such as Shocking Touch or Death
Touch), or cause damage over an area that doesn’t depend on resistance
rolls. Spells such as Affect Spirits also come in handy for insubstantial foes.</p>

<p>Mystic Knights who favor their spells should increase either IQ or Magery with
discretionary advantage points. They might also wish to spend 10 of their points
reserved for spells in an additional level of Magery. Adding an Energy Reserve
or extra FP is always useful, as well. Those who wish to emphasize their martial
side should increase DX or ST, or perhaps invest in more Born War Leader
talent. And in all cases, spending some of the points earned from quirks in
extra starting cash for armor and weapons is advisable.</p>

<p>Beyond that they can be knightly paragons (Honesty, Sense of Duty), dastardly
brigands (Greed, Callous, Bully), slightly odd from their study of magic
(Unnatural Features, Pyromania, Weirdness Magnet), or a combination of these.</p>

<h3 id="mystic-knight-power-ups">Mystic Knight Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Mystic Knights may spend extra points in spells and in anything on their
template, plus these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magery up to 6 {10/level}.</li>
  <li>Born War Leader up to 6 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Any Archmagic abilities.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Block up to 2 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Parry (one Melee Weapon skill) up to 2 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Extra Attack 1 {25}.</li>
  <li>The Armor Mastery and Shield Mastery power-ups found in <strong>DF 11</strong> p. 29.</li>
  <li>Weapon Master (Single Weapon) or Weapon Master (Weapon and Shield) {20 or 25}.</li>
</ul>

<p>As their base skill level with wizardly spells is kind of low compared to that
of a full caster, all Mystic Knights can benefit from more Magery, from an
Energy Reserve, or increased FP (which also helps with combat maneuvers).</p>

<h3 id="mystic-knights-in-gransys">Mystic Knights in Gransys</h3>

<p>Mystic Knights are more common in Gransys and neighboring nations than Magic
Archers, especially among actual knights, as the physical component of their
fighting style is already popular with that crowd. They remain relatively rare
when compared to their non-magical cousins, though.</p>

<p>Like pure Knights, they have access to Status 1 or 2 in campaigns where that
matters. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in nature the Social Stigma
(Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.</p>

<h2 id="new-perks">New Perks</h2>

<h3 id="weapon-channeling">Weapon Channeling</h3>

<p>Normally, the Staff enchantment doesn’t work if applied to something other than
a wand or staff. With this perk, available only to Mystic Knights, you become
able to use melee weapons and shields with the enchantment! You must still buy
or find items so enchanted. They can still be used to deliver touch and Melee
spells like standard Staffs. A block with a shield won’t trigger a held Melee
spell, but a shield bash or Beat with the shield will.</p>

<h2 id="new-spells">New Spells</h2>

<p>One of the signature Mystic Knight abilities in the original game is the power
to enchant all the party’s weapons with a given element at once, which saves a
lot of time when that element turns out to be required in the middle of a
fight. This is something can try replicating here by introducing a few new
spells.</p>

<p>These spells can be learned by any wizardly caster who meets the
prerequisites. They’re an efficient choice when the party is composed of two or
more adventurers who have the chance to cluster inside the affected area. GMs
worried about having their PCs waltzing into every fight with
elementally-charged weapons should disallow them!</p>

<h3 id="flame-trance-area">Flame Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Adds the effect of either Flaming Weapon or Flaming Missiles on the melee and
missile weapons held by every person in the affected area.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 5. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 2 seconds.</li>
  <li><em>Prerequisites</em>: Magery 3 and Flaming Missiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frost-trance-area">Frost Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Like Flame Trance, but adds the effects of Icy Weapon and Icy Missiles as
appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 4. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 2 seconds.</li>
  <li><em>Prerequisites</em>: Magery 2 and Icy Missiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lightning-trance-area">Lightning Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Like Flame Trance, but adds the effects of Lightning Weapon or Lightning
Missiles as appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 5. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 3 seconds.</li>
  <li><em>Prerequisites</em>: Magery 3 and Lightning Missiles.</li>

<p>As promised, here is the first of the two entirely new templates related to
Dragon’s Dogma. The Magic Archer is meant to combine the archery prowess of a
Scout with the magic of the Wizard in a more balanced way than what is possible
by using “multiclass” lenses.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-archer-250-points">The Magic Archer (250 points)</h2>

<p>You blend two tricky disciplines into an elegant, pointy whole. You’re almost as
good a shot as any Scout (<strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 10), but you chose to spend the rest of
your time learning the secrets of magic rather than getting lost in the
woods. You trade the Scout’s skill at wilderness survival for the ability to
deliver magical explosions at greater distances than the Wizard (<strong>DF 1</strong>,
p. 15).</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: ST 12 {20}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 13 {60}; HT 11 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Damage 1d-1/1d+2; BL 29 lbs (14.4kg); HP 12 {0};
Will 13 {0}; Per 13 {0}; FP 11 {0}; Basic Speed 6.00 {0}; Basic Move 6 {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Heroic Archer {20} and Magery 3 {35}. • A further 20 points
chosen from among <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">Archmagic</a> abilities or ST +1 or +2 {10 or 20 points}, DX
+1 {20}, IQ +1 {20}; HT +1 or +2 {10 or 20}, Will +1 to +4 {5/level}, Born War
Leader 1-4 {5/level}, Combat Reflexes {15}, Eidetic Memory {5} <em>or</em> Photograpic
Memory {10}, Fit {5}, Luck {15}, Magery 4 or 5 {10 or 20}, Night Vision 1-5
{1/level}, Rapid Healing {5}, Signature Gear {Varies}, Weapon Bond {1}, or
Weapon Master (Bow) {20}.</p>

{-5<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Callous {-5}, Code of Honor (Pirate’s or Soldiers) {-5 or -10}, Greed

traits or Bad Temper {-10<sup id="fnref:1:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Frightens Animals {-10}, No Sense of Humor

Features 1-5 {-1/level}, or Weirdness Magnet {-15}</p>

<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Hidden Lore (Demons, Magic Items, Magical Writings, <em>or</em>
Spirits) and Occultism, both (A) IQ {2}-13; Thaumathology (VH) IQ {1}<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>-13;
• <em>One</em> of these two missile-weapon packages:</p>

  <li>Bow (A) DX+4 {16}-17.</li>

Smallsword (A) DX+2 {4}-15 <em>or</em> Staff (A) DX+2 {4}-15.</p>

which will be either (H) IQ+1 {1}-14 or (VH) IQ {1} - 13 with the +3 from
Magery. Some of them may be spent in Archmagic abilities instead.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archers-in-gransys">Magic Archers in Gransys</h3>

<p>Magic Archers are relatively rare in Gransys, as it takes a lot of work to get
this good with both a bow and magic. Noble scions are the ones most likely to
have the necessary time on their hands, though anyone who makes a living
fighting could also acquire the necessary training during their careers. This
includes both knights and bandits!</p>

<p>In campaigns where Status and social position matter, Magic Archers have access
to Status 1 or 2, like knights. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in
nature the Social Stigma (Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.</p>

<h3 id="customization-notes">Customization Notes</h3>

<p>The Magic Archer is about as specialized as the Scout, being built around the
Spell-Archery spell and its prerequisites. A wide spell selection allows for
plenty of diferentiation between characters, and several different avenues
present themselves.</p>

<p><em>Arcane Artillerists</em> blanket the battlefield witht their magic from afar. They
take extra Magery and/or a large Energy Reserve, go for Area spells, and make
frequent use of the fact that attacking an area rather than a person gives +4 to
skill.</p>

<p><em>Sorcerous Snipers</em> focus on eliminating high-value targets. They take Weapon
Master (Bow) to improve their base damage and chose single-target damaging touch
spells to increase it even further.</p>

<p><em>Archer-Commanders</em> go for Born War Leader and choose healing and support spells
to use on allies through boffer arrows (see the Cleric-Scout lens on <strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 23 ). If using the template on a generic Dungeon Fantasy game, you could
replace Magery 3 {35} with Clerical Investment {5} and Power Investiture 3 {30}
on the template and add an apropriate required disadvantage to make it a Holy
Archer.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archer-power-ups">Magic Archer Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Magic Archers may spend earned points on extra spells and anything on their
template, plus these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magery up to 6 {10/level}.</li>
  <li>Any Archmagic abilities.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Tracking (Multiple Lock-Ons, +20%) {6/level}, with <em>no</em> upper
limit.</li>
  <li>Extra Attack 1 {25}.</li>
  <li>Zen Archery <em>without</em> needing Meditation.</li>
  <li>The Double-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 32), Quick-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) and
Strongbow (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) power-ups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">solid grasp of magic</a> in the world of Dragon’s Dogma, we
can finish our tour of its vocations and how they relate to the templates in
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. The last big category we have yet to cover are Hybrid
Vocations, which I think are one of the most distinctive aspects of the original
game.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-vocations-in-dragons-dogma">Hybrid Vocations in Dragon’s Dogma</h2>

<p>Dragon’s Dogma has three <em>hybrid vocations</em>, each of which combines aspects from
two of the color-coded categories we covered back in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/13/characters.html">Part 1</a>. They are
covered here in a little more detail than the single-color vocations were,
because I feel it’s important to examine how their concepts are executed.</p>

<p>The Red/Yellow vocation is the <em>Assassin</em>. An Assassin can equip all basic “red”
and “yellow” weapons in any combination, which allows them to have a large
number of active special abilities accessible via the equipment menu. These
abilities tend to have involve high mobility and precision damage, with some use
of explosives. An Assassin is <em>versatile</em> and fights by choosing the best weapon
for each opponent and trying to kill them quickly before they can fight back.</p>

<p>The Yellow/Blue vocation is the <em>Magic Archer</em>. They can wear heavier armor than
a pure spellcaster, and since their arrows are made of magic they use no
ammunition. Their abilities add specific elemental and “trick” effects to their
arrows (bouncing on walls, explosions, and so on). They fight mostly by
remaining at range and hitting enemies on their <em>elemental vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<p>The Red/Blue vocation is the <em>Mystic Knight</em>. Mystic Knights wear heavy armor
and wield one-handed swords or maces paired with large shields. Their abilities
allow them to reflect blocked damage back to the attacker, add elemental damage
to the whole party’s weapons at once, and place damaging mystical sigils on the
ground. They fight by <em>controlling the battlefield</em> and making sure the enemy
suffers for any decision they make.</p>

<h2 id="missing-templates">Missing Templates</h2>

<p>You might have been wondering how the two <strong>DF 1</strong> templates we haven’t
discussed yet fit into this. The short answer is they don’t.</p>

<p><em>Martial Artists</em> would seem like a good example of a Yellow/Blue template, as
they rely on agility and have access to supernatural powers. However, the
template as it stands is tied into the whole “kung-fu” aesthetic, which Dragon’s
Dogma doesn’t really go for. The “exotic but supremely skilled foreign
combatant” niche is better filled by a Swashbuckler wielding fencing weapons.</p>

<p><em>Holy Warriors</em> also seem like a good example of a Red/Blue template, but once
again the Holy Might power implies a strong connection to the divine that
doesn’t match the way magic works in this setting. Changing this template to
match Dragon’s Dogma magic would be more work than it was for the Cleric, and so
it’s better to drop it.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-templates">Hybrid Templates</h2>

<p>How can we translate the feel of these vocations into Dungeon Fantasy templates?
The obvious way would be to resort to the Mixed Profession lenses from <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level</strong>. Aside from giving players the ability to
combine powers from multiple templates, they also feel like an “advanced option”
for characters with a some experience under their belts, just like their
counterparts in the original game.</p>

<p>The other option would be to create a character from the start using a template
that draws on multiple concepts to inform their abilities. We will also look at
those options here.</p>

<p>A good way to get a versatile, “Assassin”-like character is to add a <em>Scout</em>
lens to a character who started with either the Knight or Swashbuckler
template. Alternatively, you can add the <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens to a Scout, choosing
a melee weapon such as a broadsword. This will leave you with an agile character
who is equally adept at ranged and melee combat. A small investment in the
appropriate Fast-Draw specialties and the Quick-Sheathe perk can ensure you
always have the right weapon on hand.</p>

<p>For a “Magic Archer”-like character, adding the <em>Scout</em> lens to a spellcaster
certainly helps, but the most important bit is the <em>Spell-Archery</em> spell found
in both <strong>DF 3</strong> and <strong>DF 11</strong>. Doing it the other way around (Adding a Wizard
lens to a Scout) is somewhat less efficient but still possible.</p>

<p>Similarly, a “Mystic Knight”-like character could be approximated by either a
Knight with the <em>Wizard</em> lens or a Wizard with the <em>Knight</em> lens. A Cleric with
the <em>Knight</em> or <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens would also work and give us a more balanced
approach.</p>

<p>In both cases, the choices available feel somewhat unsatisfactory, as the end
result doesn’t strike a good enough balance between the physical and magical
sides of the concept.</p>

<p>As an aside, I’m aware that there’s a <em>Mystic Knight</em> template in <strong>Pyramid
#3/13</strong>. Despite the rather fortuitous naming coincidence, I chose not to
include it because it uses Imbuements. While I like the concept of Imbuements, I
don’t like the amount of rolls their implementation adds to the average fight.</p>

<h2 id="new-templates">New Templates!</h2>

<p>So it seems we have two vacancies in our template lineup with the removal of the
Holy Warrior and Martial Artist. Given that the “Mixed Professions” route for
creating a Magic Archer or a Mystic Knight leaves something to be desired, I
feel compelled to bring the number of available templates back to 11 by creating
two entirely new templates for those vocations. This will be the subject of my
next couple of posts.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/13/characters.html">last post</a> I described how most of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 1: Adventurers</strong> would fit into the Dragon’s Dogma setting. This
included saying something about its spellcasters, and while the treatment given
to them there is minimally sufficient to help you create such a character I feel
I need to expand a bit on the magic system used in the campaign.</p>

<p>As said in the previous article, the magic system in the original game bears
enough similarities to the Spell Magic system from <strong>GURPS Magic</strong> that we can
use it in this campaign with some but not all of the modifications made to it by
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I describe that system in full. This will lay the necessary
groundwork for us to fill in the missing detail for Part 1’s magic-using
templates, and to discuss the hybrid templates in Part 3 in full.</p>

<h2 id="spells-and-magic-in-gransys">Spells and Magic in Gransys</h2>

<p>All spellcasters in this setting have Magery and use Wizardly spells. Like
Wizards in <strong>DF 1</strong>, they <em>do</em> have to learn prerequisites and <em>don’t</em> have
limited spell lists. Unlike default Wizards, they <em>do</em> have access to Healing,
Animal, Plant and Weather spells, since there are no other sources of magic to
provide them. Magery <em>can</em> be gained through study and ritual, so it can be
acquired and improved with earned character points after character creation.</p>

<p>Enchantment spells are still off-limits to PCs. Here, they are the province of
NPC artisans and armorers, the best of which have very idiosyncratic
personalities and are loathe to share their secrets with anyone.</p>

<p>Teleportation and time manipulation spells also remain off-limits. There are
some magic items that deal with that kind of stuff, however. We’ll get to them
when we cover equipment.</p>

<p>Spells to resurrect or reincarnate the dead are off-limits in this particular
setting! This is still possible with the use of certain rare artifacts, but not
even the most powerful magician can learn how to do it at will.</p>

<p>All other <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> changes to wizardly spells remain in effect.</p>

<h2 id="arcane-powers-and-power-ups">Arcane Powers and Power-Ups</h2>

<p>Something we didn’t specifically address in our discussion of Clerics and Druids
in Part 1 was what to do with the 20 points each has allocated to “Divine” and
“Druidic” abilities. In <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, those come from an explicit
connection to nature or to a deity, and both the set of available abilities and
their power modifiers reflect that. Since this isn’t true in the Dragon’s Dogma
setting, we have to find an alternate use for those points.</p>

<p>While spells should remain the main expression of magic, there is room for
something more. Little things that are always active, or even consciously
activated abilities that don’t quite follow spell mechanics. This description
applies pretty well to the existing Power-Ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>, so our list of
arcane powers will kinda blur into that. In effect, the following power/list of
power-ups is available to all spellcasting characters in the setting.</p>

<h3 id="archmagic">Archmagic</h3>

<p>Characters who advance their study of magic past a certain point discover a set
of secrets of the profession that manifest differently from traditional
spells. These are known as “Archmagics” (or “Archmagicks” in Gransys’ preferred
spelling) and are represented by the following powers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Energy Reserve (Magical) 1-20 {3/level}.</li>
  <li>Magic Resistance (Improved, +150%) {5/level} with <em>no</em> upper limit.</li>
  <li>The Inextinguishable Power and Magical Bolt power-ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>.</li>
  <li>All the General Caster Power-Ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>, including Familiars (which
are generally elemental beings and known as “Magic Agents”) and Perks.</li>
  <li>The Storms from <strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 26-27, with the addition of the Selective
Area (+20%) enhancement. This increases their cost to 42 points each.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Cleric</em> and <em>Druid</em> templates have 20 points reserved for magical abilities
that can be used for these or for additional spells. The <em>Wizard</em> template may
use any of its 30 discretionary advantage points for them.</p>

<h2 id="more-magic">More Magic?</h2>

<p>In Part 3 we will get into Hybrid Vocations (and thus, Hybrid Templates), which
have some unique magic tricks in the original game. We’ll cover these there.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Cleric, which means today’s
star is Kyra. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Kyra.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Kyra">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/kyra.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is from Qadira, her world’s Persia/Arabia equivalent. She’s the sole
survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is a cleric of <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a>, the goddess of healing, redemption,
honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a scimitar, her deity’s favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
have a “light, fire and healing” theme, and she possesses the typical D&amp;D
cleric ability to turn undead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given Sarenrae’s portfolio, we could represent Kyra with the just the base
Cleric template from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers</strong>… but the Sun
Priest lens from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics</strong> fits her better, so
let’s use that!</p>

<p>Once again we managed to hit all the major points of the original character. Her
mandatory disadvantage is the Vow, which about as inconvenient as Pacifism
(Cannot Harm Innocents) and is priced accordingly. Kyra spends one point in
extra starting cash in order to afford the scimitar (which has the same stats as
a thrusting broadsword). Instead of a sling she uses a bow, because that’s how
sun clerics roll in Dungeon Fantasy.</p>
