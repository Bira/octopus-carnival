          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The danger of thinking too much about something before putting words to screen
is that someone else might end up publishing a piece first that says what you
wanted to in a better way.</p>

<p>This just happened to me! There’s this blog called “It Came From the Bookshelf”
whose author John Frazer is reading through and reviewing his entire RPG
collection, and he recently published posts about the <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space.html">Transhuman Space
corebook</a>, <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space-broken-dreams.html">Broken Dreams</a> and now <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space-fifth-wave.html">Fifth Wave</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the main thing Mr. Frazer noticed in these posts is exactly the thing I
wanted to write about when I published that post on the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/12/13/on-cyberpunk.html">cyberpunk
genre</a>. Turns out that post started out as a big blob of text that discussed
THS. I decided to split it off into a series, published part 01, and somehow
never got around to polishing the rest of it enough. I gotta get my shit
together right now, or else there will be nothing left for me to say that Frazer
hadn’t said better.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-say">What I Wanted to Say</h2>

<p>Transhuman Space always bothered me at a fundamental level and for the longest
time I lacked the words to precisely explain how. Now those words are out there!</p>

<p>Transhuman Space markets itself as Big Idea Science Fiction inspired by what
were at the time of its writing the very latest Big Ideas. It’s in a way a
conscious rejection of the dystopic and apocalyptic tropes of “90’s RPG
cyberpunk”, and one of the things that bogged me down was an effort to describe
what <em>that</em> genre is all about. I’m still going to do it, but not today.</p>

<p>The game likes to name-drop the authors that inspired it, not just in its
bibliography but in the text itself. There’s Alvin Toffler who came up with the
concept of technological “waves”; there’s Richard Dawkins with his memetics; and
there’s Ray Kurzweil with his idea that we’ll be able to become immortal
software gods Any Day Now.</p>

<p>However, there’s another person whose influence over the setting is possibly
greater than that of the others, whose ideas are so taken for granted that he’s
not acknowledged anywhere in the books. I’m talking about Francis Fukuyama, the
guy who wrote the infamous “The End of History?” essay. This essay kinda
codifies the idea that Western liberal capitalism is the ultimate political and
economic model for humanity. You reach that, you win History, and everyone else
is just playing catch-up to you.</p>

<p>The essay was written in 1989, and it went from “well-received” to “gospel
truth” in the eyes of the developed West when the Soviet Union fell in ‘91. It
was expanded into a book in 1992, and influences a lot of terminology even
today. A “developing country” is just one that’s on the way to becoming a
“developed country” like the US and Western Europe are; if it has trouble making
the transition it’s because it has not embraced the tenets of the Ultimate Model
with enough gusto.</p>

<p>This same view is at the bedrock of Transhuman Space’s worldbuilding. The
nations who were “developed” at the end of the 20th century remain so at the end
of the 21st. Those who were “developing” also mostly remain so - they’re better
off than they were a century ago, perhaps even better off than the US was a
century ago, but they still have some “catching up” to do. The game’s definition
of “better off” is directly correlated to technological development. Better toys
equals better society. The whole “memetics” thing is part of that, since its
main narrative function is to make sociology into a hard science whose
development happens in lockstep with the other hard sciences.</p>

<p>Those who deviate from this model are pretty much the setting’s designated bad
guys, particularly the TSA. See, they follow this ideology called
“nanosocialism”, and you know it’s a dangerous and pernicious mode of thinking
because it has socialism in its name. Its core tenet is a rejection of the
concept of intellectual property, a concept which the core book asserts is vital
to maintaining peace, progress and sanity in a society that doesn’t have to
worry about material scarcity. It’s the only way a honest, hard-working
corporation can make money these days! And if corporations can’t make money,
technological progress stops! That means all progress stops! You don’t want
that, do you?</p>

<p>So the TSA are villains because they want to reach that state of technological
and social bliss enjoyed by the “proper” Fifth Wave nations by pirating their
tech instead of “earning” it. And of course they are all authoritarian
dictatorships who make weapons of mass destruction because if you already stoop
to Internet piracy no other badness is beneath you. The books try to present
some semblance of neutrality and even suggest you could run a campaign where the
PCs are working for the TSA or another info/nanosocialist outfit, but it does
that with the same perfunctory tone of someone suggesting it’s technically
possible to play as stormtroopers in Star Wars D6. Its published example
scenarios always show the TSA as antagonists.</p>

<p>Then there’s the nations in the asteroid belt and outer solar system, whose
anarcho-capitalism tends to be viewed as the next step in the refinement of the
“end of history” model. Everyone knows government regulations are the greatest
impediment to progress, so it makes perfect logical sense to do away with them
entirely. I mean, no wealthy CEO in their right mind would use unfettered
capitalism to exploit their fellow sapients. We’ve won History, that doesn’t
happen anymore!</p>

<p>I remember seeing a lot of forum posts by diehard THS fans that insisted it was
basically a realistic utopia and totally not cyberpunk, and I was silly for
thinking it was or should be. My response to that is simple.</p>

<p>Transhuman Space is absolutely a cyberpunk setting in every detail except for
one: it’s told from the perspective of the sinister corporations. If you took
almost any William Gibson novel and rewrote the story so it was told from the
perspective of its villains, their tone and setting would look a lot like
Transhuman Space’s. The gloomy Cristopher Shy art that peppers every book in the
line is not dissonant with the tone of the setting: it is, and has always been,
<em>spot on</em>.</p>

<p>And now I’m really glad to find out I’m not alone in thinking this.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators first show up in 4th Edition in the Monster Manual 2, but
since they’re also in the Monster Vault we’re getting to look at them a bit
early.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The name says it all, really. Abyssal Eviscerators come from the Abyss, and they
like to eviscerate. At Int 7, they don’t know how to do much else, but then
again they don’t want to. They frequently find themselves under the command of
stronger demons, or summoned by mortal demonologists of middling skill and
above.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 14
Brutes with 173 HP. The MM2 and MV versions are identical aside from the fixed
math. They have Speed 5, Variable Resistance 15 (2/encounter), and no special
senses.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, and they can also Grab at-will for slightly less
damage, an attack which obviously starts a grab if it hits. The MV version
specifies the demon can only grab at most two creatures at once, which is
sensible because it only has two large hands.</p>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators can also bite grabbed targets as a minor action, doing 6
automatic damage to them. They can only do this once per round normally, but can
do it up to 3 times per round while bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Nothing special here, really. These guys are basically paragon-tier evistros and
should be used in the same way.</p>

<p>Vrocks have been in D&amp;D for a long time now. They look like humanoid buzzards,
covered in dirty feathers and the occasional spike. A pair of functional wings
sprouts from their back, and they have lizard tails. They’re on both the MM and
the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Vrocks have Int 12 but that doesn’t see to do them any good. Vrocks are famously
disloyal even among demons, betraying their current master as soon as someone
they see as stronger comes around. They’ll also frequently plot to overthrow
their superiors, though those schemes rarely amount to anything. In other words,
Vrocks behave just like Starscream! I can totally see a band of them pledging
loyalty to the PCs during an adventure, pinky-swearing they’ll turn good, and
backstabbing them in the worst possible moment. The PCs ḱnow it’s coming, and
the vrocks know the PCs know. How far can the PCs take this alliance before it
falls apart?</p>

<p>Aside from plotting and backstabbing, vrocks like to engage in wholesome demonic
pasttimes such as tearing people to pieces while laughing maniacally.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The MM Vrock is a Large Elemental Humanoid (demon), and a Level 13 Skirmisher
with 132 HP. It has darkvision and variable resistance 10 (2/encounter). It
flies with speed 8 and moves on land at speed 6.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 claw, and they can make a Flyby Attack where they
fly their speed and make a claw attack at any point along the way. This doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks from the target of the claw.</p>

<p>They can also let loose a Stunning Screech that recharges on a 6, targets the
Fortitude of everyone on a Close Burst 3 and stuns affected targets for a
turn. This is not a selective attack, so the vrock’s allies can potentially be
affected by it!</p>

<p>When first bloodied, the vrock emits a cloud of Spores of Madness in a Close
Burst 2. This targets the Will of any non-demons in the area, does poison
damage, and dazes (save ends). So I guess this is what they have instead of
blood?</p>

<p>The MV Vrock loses its Stunning Screech and has fixed damage math, but is
otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I thought I was in for another bland rage machine, but what I got was Vulture
Starscream! They’re nifty. I’m a bit divided on the removal of the Stunning
Screech in the MV update. On the one hand stuns are rough, and non-selective
area attacks are a pain for your teammates. On the other hand it captures the
vrock’s Chronic Backstabbing Syndrome so well!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Anyone who is familiar with the cosmology on 3e and earlier knows it tried
really hard to have an Official Outsider for every box in the alignment
grid. Devils were Lawful Evil, Demons (our current subject) were Chaotic
Evil. And then someone created the Daemons, which served the double purpose of
filling that Neutral Evil box on the chart and having every possible spelling of
a word be a different monster.</p>

<p>Mezzodaemons were a type of daemon. Since 4e doesn’t try to follow either of
those directives above, these monsters have dropped their extraneous vowels and
are now Mezzodemons, belonging to the “demon” category. They look like upright,
human sized, trident-wielding bugs.</p>

<p>These fellows are rather “quirky” as far as demons go, because their main thing
is greed, not unbriddled bloodlust. Rather than gathering in huge hordes and
going on omnicidal rampages, they establish hidden lairs in the world or in some
other plane and loot the surrounding region. Binding a mezzodemon to your
service is as easy as paying it. Of course, they still like killing. They just
think it’s even more fun when they get paid to do it and loot the bodies
afterwards. So basically, mezzodemons are demonic murderhobos. They are only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mezzodemons are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 11 Soldiers with
113 HP. They have Resist Poison 20, and variable resistance 10 switchable 2
times per encounter. They see with darkvision and run at speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 trident, and they also have an ability called
Skewering Tines. This is a trident attack that also does ongoing damage and
restrains (save ends). While the demon is restraining someone in this way, it
can’t make any trident attacks.</p>

<p>They can also breathe poison on enemies in a Close Blast 3, targeting Fortitude
and doing both immediate and ongoing poison damage to any enemy they it. This
recharges on a 5-6, and the fact that it’s a selective attack suggests
interesting things. Maybe it’s a series of targetted squirts instead of a cloud?
Or maybe it is a cloud, but the poison is made of pure evil and anyone who hangs
out with mezzodemons is likely to be immune to it.</p>

<p>Mezzodemons are clearly meant to be team players. Maybe they engage your
defenders and restrain them while their buddies attack your back line. Or maybe
they do that to the mobile strikers instead, allowing those buddies to more
effectively gang up on them.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 11: 2 mezzodemons working as a mercenary for a
party of 2 drow warriors and 1 drow arachnomancer. This is a nasty combination
indeed, because those warriors just love to have restrained PCs to gang up on.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mezzodemons are not too exotic number-wise, but they have quite a bit of
personality and a reason to hang out with any evil group who can afford to pay
them. They work both as early opposition in a demon focused paragon arc, or as
“spice” to other evil factions. I like them more than goristros, that’s for
sure.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I think I’ve finally figured out what distinguishes a humanoid from a magical
beast in 4e. Does it have hands? If it does it’s a humanoid, if it doesn’t it’s
a magical beast.</p>

<p>That’s the only explanation that makes sense for why a Marilith is a Large
Elemental <em>Humanoid</em> (demon), despite being a six-armed lady with the lower body
of a snake. With succubi having become devils (more on that later), mariliths
have the distinction of being the most human-looking of demons. Some people even
find them sexy. Yes, I’m talking about you, dear Monster Musume fans.</p>

<p>These demons have been a part of the game for a long time, and are iconic enough
to exist both in the Monster Manual and on the Monster Vault. The two versions
are mostly identical, but we’ll still look at them separately here.</p>

<p>Mariliths are among some of the most intelligent demons at Int 14, losing only
to the Glabrezu in that field. Their appetite for destruction takes on a more
refined shape than usual: they are obsessed with martial skill, so they look for
tough opponents to fight and tend to take their gear as trophies. They store
these trophies in secret stashes on the Abyss or in the world, presumably to
prevent other demons from stealing them. It seems to me that looting such a
stash is a sure way to incur their wrath, which makes it a nice hook. Yuan-Ti
who turn to demonology are big fans of mariliths.</p>

<p>Mariliths are usually armed with six swords, one for each hand, though you could
mix and match the weapons if you wanted. In previous editions the weapons would
sometimes take a backseat to their many spell-like abilities, but here they are
definitely the main event.</p>

<p>Both versions of the Marilith are Level 24 Elite Skirmishers: they’re pretty
high up in the demonic hierarchy, such as it is. Their skill list backs this up:
they’re trained in Perception, Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, and Stealth. Yes,
mariliths can socialize if they feel the need. Their descriptions in other
editions tend to describe them as excellent tactitians and commanders, and this
definitely fits this incarnation as well.</p>

<h2 id="marilith-monster-manual">Marilith (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM Marilith has 440 HP, Darkvision, and Variable Resistance 20 (switchable
3x/encounter). They move at Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a scimitar, which is quite weak due to the math bug but
has the High Critical property. Their most commonly used attack is Shroud of
Steel, which allows them to make two scimitar attacks and use the other weapons
to parry, granting itself a +4 bonus to AC for a turn.</p>

<p>Whenever an adjacent enemy misses the marilith with a melee attack, it can make
a free scimitar attack against then. And twice per encounter (once at the start,
once after being bloodied) they can perform the Weapon Dance, which allows them
to make six scimitar attacks, shifting 1 square between each one.</p>

<h2 id="marilith-mv">Marilith (MV)</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, the MV Marilith is very similar to the MM one. It has 436 HP
instead of 440 and slightly different defenses, but retains the extensive skill
list.</p>

<p>The main changes are in its attacks. The damage on the basic scimitar attack has
been fixed, but it no longer has High Critical. Shroud of Steel now gives it a
+6 to AC. It is otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="tactics-and-encounters">Tactics and Encounters</h2>

<p>Fighting a Marilith is much like fighting a blender. Ranged attacks are much
safer than melee combat against them, but they’re fast, smart and will have
backup from other demons when encountered. You could give it some out-of-combat
rituals or abilities that allow it to prepare the terrain in advance, adding
obscuring or blocking features that limit the PC’s ability to stay away and
attack it from range. Or perhaps it just chooses a battlefield that already has
all of that and baits the PCs into it.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 23, a marilith and four hezrou. The toad
goons are just the thing to keep the fighters occupied while their boss slithers
towards the squishies.</p>
