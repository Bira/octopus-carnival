<p>I remember first reading about Shield Guardians in 3e, which is when you start
getting a lot of new constructs that are not golems. I’m not sure if they
appeared earlier than that or not. Guardians appear only on the MM here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A Guardian is a type of construct more specialized than a golem: it’s meant to
act as a bodyguard. They’re smarter and more flexible than golems at this task,
and easier to create. Unlike a golem, guardians are made of multiple materials:
metal, wood, and stone. Every guardian is linked to an amulet that gets created
alongside itself, and considers the holder of that amulet to be its master.</p>

<p>Guardians are good at detecting and intercepting threats to their master, and
will also obey the master’s orders about as well as a generic golem. They can
also be “programmed” to perform certain actions at specific times or when a
specified condition is met.</p>

<p>When a guardian’s master dies it will keep performing its last orders, until
someone else claims the amulet and becomes their new master.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two different stat blocks here. Both are Large Natural Animates with the
Construct keyword, darkvision and Perception training. They’re also immune to
charm, disease, fear, poison and sleep, which makes them sturdier than most
golems in those areas.</p>

<h3 id="shield-guardian">Shield Guardian</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 14 Soldier with 138 HP and all traits listed
above. It walks at a plodding speed of 4 and attacks with Reach 2 Slams.</p>

<p>The main feature of a shield guardian is the Shield Other aura. It has a
2-square radius, and as long as the master is within it gives the master a +2
bonus to all defenses. The guardian also absorbs half the damage taken by the
master while inside the aura.</p>

<p>The main job of a shield guardian is to stick close to its master, and punch any
enemy who comes close. It’s equipped to do that and little else, but it’s good
at its job.</p>

<h3 id="battle-guardian">Battle Guardian</h3>

<p>Battle Guardians are the sort of bodyguard that runs out to engage the master’s
enemies and cover their escape. They’re Level 17 Controllers with 163 HP and the
common traits listed above. Their speed is a much more respectable 8.</p>

<p>The battle guardian’s basic slam does damage and immobilizes on a hit (save
ends). While it remains adjacent to its master, the master’s movement doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>If an enemy ends the movement portion of a charge within 8 squares of the
guardian (which will happen if they try to charge the master, for example), the
guardian can use Block Charge as an interrupt. This is basically a
counter-charge, taking place before the enemy can actually attack. If the battle
guardian’s slam hits the enemy, they’re also knocked prone.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 14: 1 shield guardian, 1 githzerai mindmage, and 4
gray slaads. The githzerai is obviously the master here, and it’s either a
villain who consorts with slaads or a potential ally who is fighting the slads
when the PCs meet them and has to be talked down before they’ll see the PCs as
allies.</p>

<p>Guardians are OK, I suppose. Mechanically they do their jobs as designed,
increasing the survivability of their master.</p>

<p>Narratively, they might seem a bit redundant given how crowded the design space
is these days. It makes sense that artificers and wizards would come up with
several different ways to make a loyal construct, given that they all want one
and none of them is fond of sharing secrets. Having a huge variety of constructs
detracts from their uniqueness while shining the spotlight on the idiosyncrasies
of their creators, so it’s up to you which way you want to go.</p>

<p>Grimlocks appeared in a Monster Manual for the first time in AD&amp;D 2nd Edition,
though it’s likely they appeared in a 1e or earlier supplement before that. I’m
pretty sure they’re inspired by the Morlocks from H. G. Wells’ The Time
Machine. Here they’re only on the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>It seems like every “civilized” surface people has a more brutal “deep”
counterpart in the Underdark. Elves have drow, dwarves have duergar, and so
on. I’ve seen it argued that grimlocks are the equivalent of humans, though
their dramatic role is a lot closer to that of your typical Angry Humanoid like
an orc or gnoll.</p>

<p>Anyway, grimlocks are a humanoid people who apparently evolved in the
Underdark. They have no eyes, and perceive the world through their keen senses
of hearing and smell. Some sonar might also be involved here.</p>

<p>Grimlocks are quite strong, and their society has a Stone Age level of
technology. As it’s unfortunately quite common for D&amp;D, they’re described as
stupid, savage cannibals who have a particular taste for human flesh and an Evil
alignment.</p>

<p>That’s already quite enough to make them hostile to any given PC group, but
there’s more! Grimlocks are surrounded by lots of powerful, technologically
advanced evil empires, which means they often end up as slaves to drow, duergar,
mind flayers, and so on. So you might end up fighting a grimlock horde either
because they’re servants of the Big Bad, or just because they’re hungry.</p>

<p>The bit I like the most here is the statement that grimlocks <em>evolved</em> in the
Underdark. That would make them one of the only sapient species native to the
place - most others came either from the surface or from the Far Realm, as did
much of the wildlife.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Grimlocks are Medium Natural Humanoids, which corroborates the evolution
bit. Their signature traits are Blindsight 10, and the Blind keyword. This makes
them immune to sight-based effects, and allows them to fight normally in full
darkness or against invisible opponents.</p>

<p>They have no other special tricks, relying on “hard fighting” instead.</p>

<h3 id="grimlock-minion-and-grimlock-follower">Grimlock Minion and Grimlock Follower</h3>

<p>These are Minion Brutes, level 14 and 22 respectively. They fight with stone
greataxes that do a bit more damage against bloodied targets, and otherwise hope
to swarm their enemies with their huge numbers as minions often do.</p>

<p>You can expect to find large numbers of them in the service of some powerful
Underdark villain, or if you end up raiding a grimlock settlement for some
reason.</p>

<h3 id="grimlock-ambusher">Grimlock Ambusher</h3>

<p>A Level 11 Skirmisher with 110 HP, trained in Athletics and Endurance. It fights
with a greataxe that has the High Critical property.</p>

<p>Its special move is the Offensive Shift, a reaction usable when an enemy moves
within 2 squares and attacks an ally of the ambusher. It allows the creature to
shift and make a basic attack against that enemy. This recharges when the
ambusher is first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="grimlock-berserker">Grimlock Berserker</h3>

<p>This Level 13 Brute has 156 HP and seems to be visually indistinguishable from
the ambusher above. It has training in the same skills.</p>

<p>The berserker fights with a greataxe as well, and in addition to its basic
attack it can make a Power Attack that’s slightly less accurate and deals more
damage. It can also make two basic attacks against a bloodied enemy.</p>

<p>When the berserker bloodies an enemy, it gains 10 temporary HP.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 13: two berserkers, 2 hook horrors, and 1 mind
flayer infiltrator who is likely the boss of this group.</p>

<p>I’m not really a fan of grimlocks. They fill a necessary role of mind flayer
muscle but otherwise conform to all the usual Angry Humanoid stereotypes, with
the words “murderous”, “savage”, “brute”, and so on appearing rather frequently
as descriptors.</p>

<p>Mechanically they’re a bit weak, heavily affected by the damage bug due to being
paragon-tier opponents. Even the berserker’s power attack falls short of what
its basic damage output should be according to the new math. Fixing that is a
priority if you want to use grimlocks as opposition.</p>

<p>Another fantasy classic, these lion-eagle hybrids have a different spelling for
their name in every source they appear in. D&amp;D has always gone with “Griffon”
and has featured them in its bestiaries since at least BECMI and AD&amp;D 1st
Edition. In Fourth Edition they appear only in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A griffon is a large flying carnivore with the head, wings and foreclaws of a
giant eagle, and the hindquarters of some non-flying beast. They’re strong
enough to be used as flying mounts, though how easy they are to train depends on
the exact variety you’re dealing with.</p>

<p>The most common variety is called simply a Griffon, and has a lion’s
backside. They can’t be trained at all unless you start with a hatchling, but
stories tell that some elves and eladrin can use magic to control them and ride
them into battle. Griffon eggs fetch a high price on the open market (1000 GP)
from people who want a shot at training them, or who think they have that
eladrin magic figured out.</p>

<p>The ones you’re most likely to find as trained mounts are the Hippogriffs, who
have horse backsides and a considerably more tractable temperament. This makes
them the most common flying mount among the sapient people of the world. I’m
pretty sure Nerath had whole regiments of hippogriff cavalry and that the
practice survives in any post-imperial community of sufficient size.</p>

<p>Hippogriffs are brave enough that that they can readily be ridden into battle,
and they actually breed true with normal horses as well as with each other. The
offspring of a horse and a hippogriff will either be another hippogriff or a
temperamental horse. They’re expensive enough to be a prime target for thieves,
and there’s a thriving black market on young specimens.</p>

<p>Even the Elemental Chaos has its own griffon species in the form of the Rimefire
Griffon, a formidable beast that the book describes as being sapient, unlike its
natural cousins. It’s not exactly a genius at Int 4, but it still “allies” with
ice archons or gets “pressed into service” by efreets instead of being “tamed”.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Griffons are Large Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword (the Rimefire Griffon
is Elemental instead). They’re a bit slow on land, but are excellent fliers.</p>

<h3 id="hippogriff">Hippogriff</h3>

<p>The typical hippogriff is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 64 HP. It walks at speed 4
and flies at speed 10. Being a MM monster, it has a listed overland flight speed
of 15, fast enough to outrun most dragons.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a bite, and it can perform a Flyby Attack that works as
expected: the hippogriff flies it speed, attacks at any point in the movement,
and draws no opportunity attacks. It can also perform a Diving Overrun, a charge
which does more damage than the bite, knocks the target prone on a hit, and
lands the hippogriff adjacent to it.</p>

<p>As mounts, these creatures grant +1 to all of their riders’ defenses.</p>

<h3 id="hippogriff-dreadmount">Hippogriff Dreadmount</h3>

<p>An armored hippogriff that fights better on the ground. It’s a Level 5 Soldier
with 66 HP and the same speed as the standard model.</p>

<p>Dreadmounts trade their usual agility for increased battlefield control. They
fight with bites, and can do Wing Slams (Melee 1 vs. Reflex) against enemies who
try to shift or move away from them. These attacks are interrupts, doing some
damage and knocking enemies prone on a hit. They can’t be done while in the air.</p>

<p>Dreadmounts are also as stable as dwarves - they move 1 square less from forced
movement effects, and can roll an immediate save to avoid being knocked prone.</p>

<h3 id="griffon">Griffon</h3>

<p>Classic griffons are Level 7 Brutes with 98 HP. They run with speed 6, and fly
with speed 10.</p>

<p>Griffons fight with their claws, and they’re all about charging: charge attacks
give them a +4 attack bonus instead of the usual +1. When acting as mounts,
their charges allow them to make two claw attacks in addition to the rider’s
attack.</p>

<p>When bloodied, griffons lose their shit: they become immune to fear, gain an
extra move action, a +2 bonus to attacks, and a -2 penalty to defenses.</p>

<h3 id="rimefire-griffon">Rimefire Griffon</h3>

<p>These are Level 20 Skirmishers with 186 HP. Their land speed is 5, and their
flight speed 10. They have Resist 10 to both cold and fire.</p>

<p>Rimefire griffons have lion bits but fight more like hippogriffs, with a basic
bite that does physical and cold damage and the same Flyby Attack power. They
can also breathe fire (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex), an attack that starts
“uncharged” but recharges after the creature hits twice with a bite attack. When
used as a mount, the rimefire griffon grants its elemental resistances to its
rider.</p>

<p>The lore description for the fiery breath is fun: their bites absorb the
target’s body heat, causing the creature’s prominent horn to glow red-hot. Once
it stores up enough heat, it can release it as a blast.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h3>

<p>The sample encounters emphasize the role of griffons as mounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: a human mage and 2 human guards riding hippogriffs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 3 warforged soldiers and their dreadmount-riding captain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 eladrin fey knights on griffons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 Ghaele of Winter riding a rimefire griffon, accompanied by a
quartet of fire and ice archons.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like them, particularly the emphasis on them being mounts. I get the feeling
that investing in horses in D&amp;D’s implied setting is a fool’s game. You have
boar-riding dwarves, griffon-riding elves, human knights on hippogriffs, and I’m
sure there’s a ridable drake somewhere. Warhorses are so last edition.</p>

<p>I remember seeing Gricks for the first time in 3.0, but I wouldn’t be surprised
if they appear earlier than that. In this edition they’re only on the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In the previous post about Grells I complained that a lone grell was
indistinguishable from any of the many other tentacled underground
predators. Well, Gricks are one of those, and the main sources of my
confusion. They even have tentacles, a beak, and a short name that starts with
GR.</p>

<p>The main differences are that gricks are nonsapient and have worm-like bodies
instead of being floating brains. They live in caves and in the upper reaches of
the Underdark. There’s pretty much no chance for the PCs to have a nonviolent
interaction with these beasts (aside from sneaking around them, I guess). Gricks
are always either hungry and hunting, or hanging around their nests, which they
protect with murderous ferocity.</p>

<p>I note they don’t seem to have a burrowing speed, so they either need to stick
to premade caves and tunnels, or they burrow too slowly to make a difference in
combat. When food turns scarce in the grick’s preferred environment, they’ll
venture out to the surface to hunt at night, returning home before sunrise to
avoid burning out their tiny cave-adapted eyes.</p>

<p>Gricks are pack hunters and have excellent instincts for surrounding their
intended prey. They’re also really tough and hard to hurt. I wonder if bullettes
and gricks prety on each other, like sperm whales and giant squid.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="grick">Grick</h3>

<p>The default model is a Medium Aberrant Beast and a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP. It
has Resist 5 against all effects that target AC, moves with speed 6, and climbs
with speed 4. It also has darkvision.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Tentacle Rake (Melee 1 vs. AC) that does both immediate
and ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>It also has a trait named Expert Flanker that grants it a +2 attack bonus
against a target it’s flanking. That does stack with the standard +2 from combat
advantage, for a total of +4.</p>

<h3 id="grick-alpha">Grick Alpha</h3>

<p>A bigger, badder version leading a pack. It’s a Large Aberrant Beast and a Level
9 Brute (Leader) with 116 HP. It has the same damage resistance, senses, and
climb speed as the base grick, but its ground speed is 7.</p>

<p>The tentacle rake attack is almost identical, but has Reach 2 and also grabs the
target. The alpha can then use its standard actions to perform a Vicious Bite on
the grabbed target, doing automatic damage that’s a bit weaker than that of the
tentacles.</p>

<p>Why would it bother with that? Because it grants its allies a +2 attack bonus
against the grabbed victim. So while being chewed on by the alpha, the hapless
PC will also be attacked by the smaller gricks with a total bonus of +6: 2 from
CA, 2 from Expert Flanker, and 2 from this ability.</p>

<p>Of course, the alpha is an Expert Flanker itself.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>Gricks obviously don’t socialize with anyone outside their packs, but sometimes
an opportunistic predator will join a grick fight hoping to score some
scraps. They can also be enslaved by certain aberrant creatures, which seem to
be the only ones that can make any use out of these ornery worms.</p>

<p>Thus we get our two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 grick alpha, 3 standard gricks, 2 dire stirges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 2 alphas, 1 gibbering mouther, and a trio of foulspawn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like their mechanics, but the lore doesn’t inspire me all that much. They work
well enough as an incidental encounter for “natural cave” dungeons, I suppose.</p>

<p>Grells have been around since at least the 2e Monstrous Manual. In Fourth,
they’re only on the MM, but they got an update in Dungeon 192.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These beaked, tentacled brain-things live and hunt in the Underdark. Like a lot
of monsters in this book they’re carnivores who don’t mind if their prey is
sapient. Though blind, they perceive the world through their latent psychic
powers.</p>

<p>Grells are sapient, but lone grells tend to lead a feral existence and behave
pretty much like clever pretadors. Those tend to be exceptions, though. Grell
most often organize themselves in hive-like colonies with dozens of individuals,
led by the most intelligent and powerful among them. These colonies are
expansionist, though they tend to see their territory more as a hunting ground
than as any sort of empire. Grell colonies don’t go for subtle manipulation,
either.</p>

<p>Grells have a venomous bite, and venomous spines on the tips of their
tentacles. Their leaders are called Philosophers, and have stronger psychic
powers on top of that.</p>

<p>One interesting fact added by the Dungeon update is that brains are poisonous to
grells! They’ll eat every other bit of their victims, but will either discard
the brains or keep them in reserve for trade if there’s a mind flayer colony
near their territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Grells are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts who lack eyes and thus are immune to
gaze attacks. They have Blindsight 12 and fly with speed 6 (hover). A grounded
grell is reduced to a ground speed of 1 (clumsy). They’re Evil, communicate via
Deep Speech, and are trained in Stealth and Perception.</p>

<h3 id="grell">Grell</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 7 Elite Soldier with 156 HP. Its basic attack is a
Tentacle Rake (Melee 2 vs. AC) using those spines, and while it does the damage
expected by the new math that’s only because the designers went with the “one
double-damage attack” approach for this elite monster. In addition to doing
damage, the tentacles slow the target and give it a -2 penalty to attacks (save
ends both).</p>

<p>Instead of raking, the grell can attempt a Tentacle Grab (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude)
which does a bit less damage than the rake and grabs the target. The grell can
only grab one victim at a time, and enjoys a +2 bonus to AC while it’s grabbing
someone.</p>

<p>As a 1/round minor action, the grell can use its Venomous Bite (vs. AC) against
a grabbed victim, dealing a bit of physical damage and stunning them (save
ends).</p>

<p>You can expect a grell to be able to keep one PC stunlocked and the rest of them
slowed. The update gives them two attacks per turn, each of which can be a
Tentacle Rake or a Tentacle Grab. They retain their stunning bite, but the stun
also ends when the grab does in addition to being (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="grell-philosopher">Grell Philosopher</h3>

<p>Philosophers are Level 11 Elite Controllers with 224 HP. They have Resist 20
Lightning on top of the common grell’s traits. Their basic attack is still the
tentacle rake, whose damage is only 1 point higher than that of a standard
grell.</p>

<p>They have a ranged attack in the form of a Lightning Lance (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) which does lightning damage and blinds (save ends). If there are a
lot of PCs nearby they can instead use their Venomous Mind (Close Burst 3
vs. Will, enemies only) which does psychic damage and forces its victims to
choose random targets for any melee attacks they make (save ends). I love these
unique conditions.</p>

<p>Occasionally the philosopher will be able to cause a Psychic Storm (Area Burst 2
within 10 vs. Will; recharge 6) which does psychic damage and dazes (save
ends). The storm lingers as a zone until the end of the encounter, dazing anyone
caught within (save ends).</p>

<p>Psychic storm is always available at the beginning of the fight, so that’s going
to be the opener almost every time. It’s not a “friendly” area, so some care is
required in its placement. Venomous mind is an excellent power to use on the PCs
stunlocked by the philosopher’s underlings.</p>

<p>The dungeon update left them pretty much identical, aside from the usual damage
improvements.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one grell encounter here, which is level 11: a philosopher, 2 standard
grells, and 4 troglodyte minions. The lore didn’t give me the impression grells
would work alongside anyone else, but the troglodyte association here is
interesting. This works as a good boss battle for level 8-9 characters.</p>

<p>I think grells are a lot more interesting when they’re in colonies. As lone
feral predators they’re interchangeable with a lot of other tentacled Underdark
beasties.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that 2e seems to have described them as having a higher
level of technology: they worn spear-tips on their tentacles, used magic items,
and the Lightning Lance was an actual weapon instead of a psychic power. I
wonder how much stress this caused GMs whose players looted a bunch of +5 rings
and rayguns from a group of grells. So in that way it’s a good thing that these
things are no longer in the game. Still, if you’re looking for some treasure to
assign to a grell encounter, these items might be a good inspiration.</p>

<p>2e used to also have Grell Patriarchs as the “tier” above
Philosophers. Patriarchs were large sapient masses of flesh that acted as the
core of spelljammer vessels. If you’re including spelljamming in your campaign
you could bring them back.</p>
